Our Dean called a meeting yesterday of all faculty to discuss the university’s new academic plan, and what it means for all the academic departments in the Faculty. I knew there had been meetings earlier in the year, a few of which I’d attended, but it seemed to be the same old waffle about building a university fit for a new age, and revolutionizing the way we teach. But those discussions didn’t seem to affect the courses I’m teaching – it was clear early on that there was no threat to the department being closed down. If anything, it looked like my classes would be getting even bigger, with the usual statements about having to do more with less. My research is going well, and there was no talk this time round about having to take on an increased teaching load. At that point, I’d switched off: I’d been through all this many times before. But as soon as the dean started yesterday, I sensed trouble. He started talking about the need for the department to be more ‘flexible’ in its teaching. What the hell does that mean – yoga exercises at the beginning of each lecture? Then he went on to talk about ‘defining clear learning outcomes’ and ‘personalizing learning.’ Well, that’s stupid. Anyone knows that you have to internalize what you learn or it doesn’t happen. And my courses are changing all the time – if I set outcomes even at the beginning of a course, they’ll probably be different by the time we get to the end. But then the real kicker, when I knew things were going to be difficult. ‘We want to have at least 50 per cent of all classes taught in a blended or hybrid manner within the next five years.’ OK, I guess I could handle that – I’ve been using the LMS to back up my lectures already, but when he said that means offering the same content across different courses, and getting rid of most lectures, I really started to worry. He started rambling on about needing to serve all kinds of learners from high school entrants to lifelong learners, and for us all to teach in teams, with the senior faculty member as a teaching consultant. Now if he thinks I’m going to let some of the other idiots in this department decide what I’m going to teach, he’s out of his mind. The scary part is that I think the Dean really believes all this claptrap. But when I really started to panic is when he said we would all have to start taking courses on how to teach. Now I get pretty good student ratings for my lectures – they just love my jokes – and I’m NOT having anyone telling me how to teach my subject. I’m one of the top people in my area of research in this country, and what the hell does the administration know about how to teach it? And when am I going to find the time, anyway, to take courses? I’m already working flat out. Why don’t they just leave us alone, and trust us to get on with the job we’re paid to do?’ If any of that rings a bell, this is the book for you. xi For my comments on the scenario, click on the podcast below About the book – and how to use it ThisisthesecondeditionofTeaching in a Digital Age.ThefirsteditionwaspublishedinApril2015.

Yet these are the very skills needed by students in a knowledge-based society. • The wide diversity of the student body is a major challenge for institutions. This requiresmore focus on teaching methods that provide support for learners, more individualization of learning, and more flexible delivery. • Online learning is a continuum; every instructor and every institution now needs to decide: where on this continuum of teaching should a particular course or program be? • As more academic content becomes openly and freely available, students will look increasingly to their local institutions for support with their learning, rather than for the delivery of content. This puts a greater focus on teaching skills and less on subject expertise. • Faculty and instructors need a strong framework for assessing the value of different technologies, new or existing, and for deciding how or when these technologies make sense for them (and/or their students) to use. 15 1.1 Structural changes in the economy: thegrowth of a knowledge society Figure 1.1.1 Learning in a digital age Image: © CC Duncan Campbell, 2012 1.1.1The digital age In a digital age, we are surrounded, indeed, immersed, in technology.

How can we ensure that we are developing the kinds of graduates from our courses and programs that are fit for an increasinglyvolatile,uncertain,complexandambiguousfuture?Whatshouldwecontinuetoprotectin our teaching methods (and institutions), and what needs to change? To answer these questions, thisbook: • discussesthe main changesthat are leading to a re-examination of teaching and learning; • identifies different understandings ofknowledgeand the different teaching methods associated with theseunderstandings; • analyses the key characteristics oftechnologies with regard to teaching and learning; • recommendsstrategies for choosing between media and technologies; • recommendsstrategiesfor high quality teaching in a digital age. InthischapterI setoutsomeofthemaindevelopmentsthat areforcingareconsiderationofhow we should be teaching. 1.1.2The changing nature of work Ofthemanychallengesthatinstitutionsface,oneisinessenceagoodone,andthatisincreaseddemand, particularlyforpost-secondaryeducation.Figure1.1.2belowrepresentstheextenttowhichknowledge has become an increasingly important element of economic development, and above all in job creation. Figure 1.1.2: The knowledge component in the workforce Thefigureissymbolicratherthanliteral.Thepalebluecirclesrepresentingthewholeworkforcein eachemploymentsectormaybelargerorsmaller,dependingonthecountry,astoowillbetheproportion of knowledge workers in that industry, but at least in developed countries and also increasingly in economically emerging countries, the knowledge component is growing rapidly: more brains and less brawn are required (seeOECD,2013a). Economically, competitive advantage goes increasingly to those companies and industries that can leverage gains in knowledge (OECD, 2013b).Indeed, knowledgeworkers often create their own jobs, starting up companies to provide new services or products that did not exist before they graduated. Fromateachingperspectivethebiggestimpactislikelytobeontechnicalandvocationalinstructors andstudents,wheretheknowledgecomponentofformerlymainlymanualskillsisexpandingrapidly.

These might include the ability to create a short YouTube video to capture the demonstration of a process or to make a sales pitch, the ability to reach out through the Internet to a wide community of people with one’s ideas, to receive and incorporate feedback, to share information appropriately, to identify trends and ideas from elsewhere; • the ability to learn independently: this means taking responsibility for working out what you need to know, and where to find that knowledge. This is an ongoing process in knowledge-based work, because the knowledge base is constantly changing. Incidentally I am not talking here necessarily of academic knowledge, although that too is changing; it could be learning about new equipment, new ways of doing things, or learning who are the people you need to know to get the job done; • ethics and responsibility: this is required to build trust (particularly important in informal social networks), but also becausegenerally ethical and responsible behaviour is in the long run more effectivein a world where there are many different players, and a greater degree of reliance on others to accomplish one’s own goals; • teamwork and flexibility: although many knowledge workers work independently or in very small companies, they depend heavily on collaboration and the sharing of knowledge with others in related but independent organizations. In small companies, it is essential that all employees work closely together, share the same vision for a company and help each other out. In particular, knowledge workers need to know how to work collaboratively, virtuallyandat adistance, with colleagues, clients and partners.The ‘pooling’ of collective knowledge, problem-solving and implementation requires good teamwork and flexibility in taking on tasks or solving problems that may be outside a narrow job definition but necessary for success; • thinking skills (critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, originality, strategizing, for example): of all the skills needed in a knowledge-based society, these are the most important. Businesses increasingly depend on the creation of new products, new services and new processes to keep down costs and increase competitiveness. Also, it is not just in the higher management positions that these skills are required. Trades people in particular are increasingly having to be problem-solvers rather than following standard processes, which tend to become automated. Anyone dealing with the public in a service function must identify needs and find appropriate solutions.Universities in particular have always prided themselves on teaching such intellectual skills, but the move to larger classes and more information transmission, especially at the undergraduate level, undermines this assumption; • digital skills: most knowledge-based activities depend heavily on the use of technology. However the key issue is that these skills need to be embedded within the knowledge domain in which the activity takes place. This means for instance real estate agents knowing how to use geographical information systems to identify sales trends and prices in different geographical locations, welders knowing how to use computers to control robots examining and repairing pipes, radiologists knowing how to use new technologies that ‘read’ and analyze MRI scans. Thus the use of digital technology needs to be integrated with and evaluated through the knowledge-base of the subject area; • knowledge management: this is perhaps the most over-arching of all the skills. Knowledge is not only rapidly changing with new research, new developments, and rapid dissemination of ideas and practices over the Internet, but the sources of information are increasing, with a great deal of variability in the reliability or validity of the information. Thus the knowledge that an engineer learns at university can quickly become obsolete. There is so much information now in the health area that it is impossible for a medical student to master all drug treatments, medical procedures and emerging science such as genetic engineering, even within an eight year program. Thusknowledge management is the key skill in a knowledge-based society: how to find, evaluate, analyze, apply and disseminate information, within a particular context. Above all students need toknow how to validate or challenge sources of information.Effective knowledge managementis a skill thatallgraduates will need to employ long after graduation. In 2018, the Royal Bank of Canada issued a report, called ‘Humans Wanted.’ This was based on an analysisofbigdataderivedfromjobpostingsovera12monthperiodonLinkedIn,inwhichtheactual skillsbeingrequestedbyemployers wereidentifiedandanalysed,andfromwhich ananalysisofthe demand for different types of labour was conducted. Themainconclusionofthereport wasthattherewillbeplentyofjobsinthefuture,buttheywill require different skills from those generally required at the present. In particular, many of the new skillsneededwillbewhatareperhapsconfusinglycalledsoftskills,suchasattentivelistening,critical thinking,digitalfluency,activelearning,etc.(confusing,becausethese‘softskills’areoftenasdifficult tocultivateas‘hardskills’.)TheseareskillsthatautomationandAIcannoteasilyreplicateorreplace butwhichwillbeneededinthenewdigitaleconomy.TheRoyalBankidentifiedthefollowingaskey skillsthatwillbeinhighdemandbetween2018and2023(darkblue=veryimportant;lighterblue= important): Two of the main conclusions from the Royal Bank report were as follows: • Canada’seducationsystem,trainingprogramsandlabourmarketinitiativesareinadequately designed to help Canadian youth navigate this new skills economy. • Canadian employers are generally not prepared, through hiring, training or retraining, to recruitanddeveloptheskillsneededtomaketheirorganizationsmorecompetitiveinadigital economy. 1.2.4 Developing skills Whatmethodsofteachingaremostlikelytodevelopsoftskills?Infact,wecanlearnalotfromresearch about skills and skill development (see, for instance,Fischer, 1980,Fallow and Steven, 2000): • skills development is relatively context-specific. In other words, skills need to be embedded within a knowledge domain. For example, problem solving in medicine is different from problem-solving in business.First of all, of course, the content base used to solve problems is different. Less well understood though is that somewhat different processes and approaches are used to solve problems in these domains (for instance, decision-making in medicine tends to be more deductive, business more intuitive; medicine is more risk averse, business is more likely to accept a solution that will contain a higher element of risk or uncertainty). Embedding skills within a particular context such as a subject discipline is perhaps the biggest challenge for educational institutions in a digital age. How well does an ability to think critically about English literature transfer to other areas of critical thinking, such as political analysis or assessing the behaviour of a workplace colleague?In many cases, some elements of these soft skills do transfer well but other parts are more context specific. More attention needs to be paid to what is known about the transfer of skills, based on research, and to ensuring this evidence affects the way we teach. • learners need practice – often a good deal of practice – to reach mastery and consistency in a particular skill; • skills are often best learned in relatively small steps, with ‘jumps’ increasing as mastery is approached; • learners need feedback on a regular basis to learn skills quickly and effectively; immediate feedback is usually better than late feedback; • although skills can be learned by trial and error without the intervention of a teacher, coach, or technology, skills development can be greatly enhanced or speeded up with appropriate interventions, which means adopting appropriate teaching methods and technologies for skills development; • we shall see later that althoughcontent can be transmitted equally effectively through a wide range of media,skills development is much more tied to specific teaching approaches and technologies. What are the implications of this for not only teaching methods, but also curriculum design?It is worthrememberingthatunlikecompetencies,many‘high-level’softskillssuchascriticalthinkingare cumulativeanddonothaveaclearend-point.SerenaWilliamskeepswinningnotbecauseshecontinues togetfasterandstrongerthanyoungerplayers,butbecauseshecontinuestohoneherskills(including strategy) to a level that compensates for her diminishing strength and speed. Softskillsneedtobedevelopedoveraprogram(indeedalifetime)ratherthaninasinglecourse.How doweidentifythenhowtobuildcriticalthinkingskillsforexamplefromfirstyearthroughtograduation inaparticulardiscipline?Howdoesthedevelopmentofskillsinlaterstagesbuildonworkdoneearlier in a program? 1.2.5Measuring skills Anotherchallengeismeasuringskills.I wasoncequestionedby acolleaguewhenIsaidmystudents were learning to think critically. ‘How do you know?’ he said. My answer was: ‘I know it when I see it in their assessments.’ ‘But how will your students know what you are looking for if you can’t describe it in advance?’ TheHigherEducationQualityCouncilofOntario(HEQCO)publishedareportin2018thatclaimed to be‘one ofthe first major attempts to measure employment-related skills in university and college studentsonalargescale.’Thesecondstudyusedatestdesignedtoevaluatestudents’abilitytoanalyse evidence, understand implications and consequences, and develop valid arguments. The HEQCO study concluded that final-year students had somewhat higher scores in literacy and numeracythantheirfirst-yearcounterparts,althoughtherewasconsiderablevariationamongprograms, but little difference between the test scores of incoming and graduating students in critical-thinking abilities,although critical thinking ability too showed considerable variation among programs. There are a number of possible criticisms of this study. One of the challenges that the HEQCO studyfacedwasfindingvalidandreliablewaystoassesssoftskills.Thefirststudymeasuredliteracy, numeracy and problem-solving abilities of adults using everyday scenarios.Why assess these skills outsidetheknowledgedomainsinwhichtheyweretaught,giventheimportanceofcontext?Werethe measurements sensitive enough to really discriminate differences in skill development over time? Nevertheless,itisworryingthatHEQCOfoundthatafterfouryearsofpost-secondarystudytherewas nonoticeabledifferenceincriticalthinkingskills.Isthisbecausethisisnotbeingwelltaught,orbecause the tests used were not valid? Any attempt to identify learning outcomes involving skills requires consideration from the beginning of how these skills can validly be assessed. Instructors should not complainaboutHEQCO’sassessmentmethodsiftheycannotjustifytheirownmethodsofidentifying and assessing skills. 1.2.6Skills and learning outcomes The Royal Bank of Canada and the HEQCO studies both highlight that it is becoming increasingly important to define learning outcomes in terms of skills acquisition.Both these are valuable studies thatidentifysomeoftheissuesarounddevelopingtheknowledgeandskillsthatstudentswillneedto succeed,notjustintheworkforce,butinlifegenerallyinthelastthreequartersofthiscentury.However, thetworeportshavebarelytouchedthetipofthisparticulariceberg.Neitherforinstanceattemptedto suggest how studentscandeveloptheseskills orwhatinstructorsneed todotohelpstudentsdevelop such skills. Whendevelopingcurricular,intermsofdecidingnotonlywhatbutalsohowtoteach,weneedtoask the following questions: (a)are programs identifying clearly the learning outcomes expected from a program of study? (b) do these learning outcomes sufficiently take into account skills as well as content/topics? (c)are these learning outcomes relevant for a digital society? In other words, we have a major pedagogical challenge in several parts: • identifying the most important soft skills that students will need (although the RBC report goes a little way in that direction) • identifying the best way to teach such soft skills • assessing students’ ability in soft skills (although the HEQCO report similarly goes a little way in that direction) • identifying the extent to which soft skills are generalisable. The key point here is that content and skills are tightly related and as much attention needs to be giventoskillsdevelopmentastocontentacquisitiontoensurethatlearnersgraduatewiththenecessary knowledge and skills for a digital age. 1.2.7Rethinking teaching and learning Theseareessentiallycurriculumandpedagogicalissues.Itmeansrethinkingnotonlythecurriculumand howweteachit,butalsotherolethattechnologycanplayindevelopingsuchskills.Howcantechnology increaseempathyandunderstanding(forexample,throughcreatingvirtualenvironmentsorsimulations wherestudentsplaytheroleofothers)?Howcantechnologybeusedtoprovidescenariosthatenable skillsdevelopmentandtestinginasafeenvironment?Howcantechnologybeusedtoenablestudentsto solve real world problems? Thereareamillionpossibleanswerstosuchquestionsandtheyneedtobeansweredbyinstructors andteachers–andbylearners–withdeepunderstandingoftheirsubjectmatter.Butsubjectknowledge aloneisnotenoughifwearetomakethelastthreequartersofthe21stcenturyatimewhenallpeople can thrive and feel free. Chapters 2 and 3 explore different methods of teaching and will look at how well these methods accommodate skills development.

However, the HEQCO study (Weingarten et al., 2018) indicates that high-level soft skills are hard to measure and probably need to be defined and communicated more clearly and purposefully by instructors. In particular,developmentofsuchskillsneedtobeconsideredataprogramlevelsoinstructorscandefine what level of skill they expect of students when they arrive, and to what level that skill has been increased or improved by the end of a course or program. A good example of this is from the Faculty of Computer Science at Dalhousie University.

Universities are deliberately designed to resist external pressure.They have seen kings and popes, governments and business corporations, comeandgo,withoutanyoftheseexternalforcesfundamentallychangingthenatureoftheinstitution. Universitiespridethemselvesontheirindependence,theirfreedom,andtheircontributiontosociety.So let’sstartbylooking,verybriefly,atthesecorevalues,becauseanychangethatreallythreatensthese core values is likely tobe strongly resisted from professors and instructors within the institution. Universities are fundamentally about the creation, evaluation, maintenance and dissemination of knowledge. This role in society is even more important today than in the past. For universities to perform that role adequately, though, certain conditions are necessary. First they need a good deal of autonomy. The potential value of new knowledge in particular is difficult to predict in advance. Universities provide society with a safe way of gambling on the future, by encouraging innovative research and development that may have no immediate apparent short-term benefits, or may lead to nowhere, without incurring major commercial or social loss. Another critical role is the ability to challengetheassumptionsorpositionsofpowerfulagenciesoutsidetheuniversity,suchasgovernment orindustry,whentheseseemtobeinconflictwithevidenceorethicalprinciplesorthegeneralgoodof society. Perhapsevenmoreimportantly,therearecertainprinciplesthatdistinguishacademicknowledgefrom everydayknowledge,suchasrulesoflogicandreasoning,theabilitytomovebetweentheabstractand theconcrete,ideassupportedbyempiricalevidenceorexternalvalidation(seeforinstance,Laurillard, 2001).

Also, as aresult ofhigher tuitionfeesandincreased student debt tofinance university and college education, students and parents are becoming more demanding, more like customersthanscholarsinanacademiccommunity.Poorteachinginparticularisbothvisibleandless and less acceptable to students paying high tuition fees. The general complaint from faculty is that government or the institutional administration has not increasedfundingforfacultyinproportiontotheincreaseinstudentnumbers.Infact,thesituationis much more complicated than that. Most institutions that have expanded in terms of student numbers have handled the expansion through a number of strategies: • hiring more contract/sessional lecturers at lower salaries than tenured faculty • greater use of teaching assistants who themselves are students • increasing class sizes • increasing faculty workload. Allofthesestrategiestendtohaveanegativeimpactonquality,ifthemethodsofteachingotherwise remain unchanged. Contract instructors are cheaper to employ than full time professors but they do not usually have the same roles such as choice of curriculum and reading materials as tenured faculty, and although oftenwellqualifiedacademically,therelativelytemporarynatureoftheiremploymentmeansthattheir teachingexperienceandtheirknowledgeofstudentsarelostwhentheircontractsend.However,ofall thestrategies,thisislikelytohavetheleastnegativeimpactonquality.Unfortunatelythoughitisalso the most expensive for institutions. Teaching assistants maybe nomorethanacoupleofyearsaheadintheirstudiesthanthestudents theyareteaching,theyareoftenpoorlytrainedorsupervisedwithregardtoteaching,andsometimes, ifthey areforeignstudents(asisoftenthecase),theirEnglishlanguageskills arepoor, makingthem sometimesdifficulttounderstand.Theytendtobeusedtoinstructparallelsectionsofthesamecourse, sothatstudentsstudyingthesamecoursemayhavewidelydifferentlevelsofinstruction.Employingand payingteachingassistantscanbedirectlylinkedtothewaythatpost-graduateresearchisbeingfunded by government agencies. The increase in class size hastendedtoresultinmuchmoretimebeingdevotedtolecturesandless timetosmallgroupwork.Lecturesareinfactaveryeconomicalwayofincreasingclasssize(provided thatthelecturehallsarelargeenoughtoaccommodatetheextrastudents).Themarginalcostofadding an extra student to a lecture is small, since all students are receiving the same instruction.

Thus government is increasingly looking for ways to make higher education institutions more productive: more and better students for the same cost or less (see for instance Kao, 2019).

If you could change the way you teach, what would be the main benefits to both yourself and your students? What would need to change for this to happen? There is no feedback on this activity 1.6 Changing students, changing markets for higher education 45 Figure 1.6.1 More diverse students Image: © greatinternational students.blogspot.com, 2013 1.6.1 Greater diversity of students Probably nothing has changed more in higher education over the last 50 years than the students themselves. In ‘the good old days’, when less than a third of students from high schools went on to higher education, most came from families who themselves had been to university or college. They usuallycamefromwealthyoratleastfinanciallysecurebackgrounds.Universitiesinparticularcouldbe highlyselective,takingstudentswiththebestacademicrecords,andthusthosemostlikelytosucceed. Classsizesweresmallerandfacultyhadmoretimetoteachandlesspressuretodoresearch.Expertisein teaching,whileimportant,wasnotasessentialthenasnow;goodstudentswereinanenvironmentwhere theywerelikelytosucceed,eveniftheprof wasnotthebestlecturerintheworld.This‘traditional’ model still holds true for most elite private universities such as Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Oxford and Cambridge,andfor anumberofsmallerliberal artscolleges.Butforthemajorityofpubliclyfunded universitiesandtwoyearcommunitycollegesinmostdevelopedcountries,thisisnolongerthecase(if it ever was). The student base has become much more diverse.For instance, in British Columbia, roughly two.thirds ofthe full Grade8school cohortof2007/2008(67%)enteredB.C.publicpost.secondary educationbyFall2014(Heslop,2016).Asstatejurisdictionspushinstitutionstoparticipationratesof around70percentgoingontosomeformofpost-secondaryeducation(Ontario,2011),institutionsmust reachouttopreviouslyunderservedgroups,suchasethnicminorities(particularlyAfro-Americanand LatinosintheUSA),newimmigrants(inmostdevelopedcountries),aboriginalstudentsinCanada,and students with English as a second language. Governments are also pushing universities to take more internationalstudents,whocanbechargedfulltuitionfeesormore,whichinturnaddstothecultural andlanguagemix.Inotherwords,post-secondaryinstitutionsareexpectedtorepresentthesamekindof socio-economicandculturaldiversityasinsocietyatlarge,ratherthanbeinginstitutionsreservedforan elite minority. We shall also see that in many developed countries,university and college students areolderthan theyused tobeand arenolongerfull-timestudentsdedicatedonly tolotsofstudyand somefun(or viceversa).Theincreasing costoftuitionfeesandlivingexpensesforcesmanystudents nowtotake part-time work, which inevitably conflicts with regular classroom schedules, even if the students are formallyclassifiedasfull-timestudents.Asaresultstudentsaretakinglongertograduate.IntheUSA, the average completion time for a four year bachelor degree is now5.1 years (Shapiro, et al., 2016). 1.6.2 The lifelong learning market TheCouncilofOntarioUniversities(2012)notedthatstudentsNOTcomingdirectfromhighschool nowconstitute24%ofall newadmissions,andenrolmentsfromthis sectorareincreasingfasterthan thosefromstudentscomingdirectfromhighschools.Perhaps moresignificantly, manygraduates are returning later in their careers totake further courses or programs, in order to keep up in their ever.changingknowledgedomain.Manyofthesestudentsareworkingfull-time,havefamiliesandarefitting their studies around their other commitments. Figure 1.6.2 Lifelong learners are an increasingly important market for higher education Image: © Evolllution.com, 2013 Yetitiseconomicallycriticaltoencourageandsupportsuchstudents,whoneedtoremaincompetitive inaknowledge-basedsociety.especiallyaswithfallingbirthratesandlongerlives,insomejurisdictions lifelonglearners,studentswhohavealreadygraduatedbut arecomingbackformorestudy, willsoon exceed the number of students coming directly from high school.Thus at the University of British ColumbiainCanada,themeanageofallitsgraduatesstudentsisnow31,andmorethanonethirdofall studentsareover24yearsold.Thereisalsoanincreaseinstudentstransferringfromtwoyearcolleges touniversities–andviceversa.Forinstance,inCanada,attheBritishColumbiaInstituteofTechnology more than 20 per centof its new enrolments each year already have a university degree. 1.6.3 Digital natives Another factor that makes students somewhat different today is their immersion in and facility with digitaltechnology,andinparticularsocialmedia:instantmessaging,Twitter, videogames,Facebook, andawholehostofapplications(apps)thatrunonavarietyofmobiledevicessuchasiPadsandmobile phones. Such students are constantly ‘on’. Most students come to university or college immersed in social media, and much of their life evolves around such media.

The massification of higher education has, to the alarm of traditionalists, opened up the academy to the great unwashed. However, the massification of higher education is needed as much for economic reasons as for social mobility. The implications of these changes in the student body for university and college teaching are profound. At one time, German math professors used to pride themselves that only five to ten per cent of their students would succeed in their exams. The difficulty level was so high that only the verybestpassed.Atinycompletionrateshowedhowrigoroustheirteachingwas.Itwasthestudents’ responsibility, nottheprofessors’, toreachthelevelrequired.Thatmaystillbethegoalfortoplevel research students, but we have seen that today universities and colleges have a somewhat different purpose, and that is to ensure, as far as possible, that as many students as possible leave university appropriatelyqualifiedforlifeinaknowledge-basedsociety.Wecan’taffordtothrowawaythelivesof 95percentofstudents,eitherethicallyoreconomically.Inanycase,governmentsareincreasinglyusing completion rates and degrees awarded as key performance indicators that influence funding. Itisamajorchallengeforinstitutionsandteacherstoenableasmanystudentsaspossibletosucceed, given the wide diversity of the student body.

Some of the ways technology is moving from the periphery to the centre can be seen from the following trends. 1.7.1. Fully online learning Credit-basedonlinelearninginrecentyearshasbecomeamajorandcentralactivityofmostacademicdepartments inuniversities,collegesandtosomeextenteveninschool/k-12education. Onlinelearningenrolmentsincreasedbybetween10-20percentperannumbetween2002and2012inNorth Americanhighereducationinstitutions,comparedwithanincreaseincampus-basedenrolmentsofaround2-3per centperannum(AllenandSeaman,2014). 51 Figure 1.7.2 From Allen and Seaman, 2014 InjusttheCaliforniaCommunityCollegeSystemalone,therearealmostonemilliononlinecourseenrolments (JohnsonandMejia,2014).TherearenowatleastsevenmillionstudentsintheUSAtakingatleastonefullyonline course,almost30percentofallpost-secondarystudentsintheUSA;and14percentofallstudentsare taking only distanceeducation courses.Themajorityofthesefullyonlineenrolments(just overtwo.thirds)areinpublicinstitutionsintheUSA(onlineenrolmentsinfor-profitinstitutionsplungedafter 2012duetoObama-eraregulation).Atthesametime,thenumberofstudentsstudyingonacampusin theUSAdroppedbyalmostonemillion(931,317)between2012and2015(DigitalLearningCompass, 2017). ThesituationinCanadaissomewhatsimilar.MostCanadianpost-secondaryinstitutions(83percent) offered fully online courses for credit in 2017.Roughly 17 per cent of all students were taking at least one onlinecourse;online course registrations totalled 1.3million, accounting for eight per cent of all credit course enrolments. This is equivalent in a system with roughly 70 universities and 150 publiccollegestofouradditionaluniversitiesof27,000students,andfiveadditionalcollegesof10,000 students.Onlinelearningwasconsideredbyinstitutionalleaderstobeveryorextremelyimportantfor the institution’s future in over two-thirds of all institutions (Bates et al,2018) Thusfullyonlinelearningisnowakeycomponentofmanyschoolandpost-secondaryeducationsystems. 1.7.2. Blended and hybrid learning As more instructors have become involved in online learning, they have realised that much that has traditionallybeendoneinclasscanbedoneequallywellorbetteronline(athemethatwillbeexplored moreinChapter10,Section2).As aresult, instructors have beengraduallyintroducing more online studyelements into theirclassroom teaching.Solearningmanagement systems maybeused tostore lecturenotesintheformofslidesorPDFs,linkstoonlinereadingsmaybeprovided,oronlineforums for discussion may be established. Thus online learning is gradually being blended with face-to-face teaching,butwithoutchangingthebasicclassroomteachingmodel.Hereonlinelearningisbeingused asasupplementtotraditionalteaching.Althoughthereisnostandardorcommonlyagreeddefinitions in this area, I will use the term ‘blended learning’ for this use of technology. More recently, though, lecture capture has resulted in instructors realising that if the lecture is recorded,studentscouldviewthisintheirowntime,andthentheclassroomtimecouldbeusedformore interactive sessions. This model has become known as the ‘flipped classroom’. Anevenmoresignificantmove,butstillinaminorityofclasses,isthemovetohybridlearning,where some,butnotall,ofregularclassroomtimeisreplacedbyonlineactivities.Thissometimesleadstoa complete re-design of the teaching experience for students. Some institutions are now developing plans to move a substantial part of their teaching into more blendedor flexible modes. Almost two-thirds of the institutions in the 2017 Canadian survey either hadaplanforonlinelearning orweredevelopingone,andanother30percent reportedthattheydid not have a plan but needed one. For instance in 2013 the University of Ottawa developed a plan to have at least 20 per cent of its courses blended or hybrid within five years (University of Ottawa, 2013).The University of British Columbia has a plan to redesign most of its first and second year large lectureclassesintohybridclasses.Furthermore,someinstructorsareincorporating emerging technologies such as simulations and educational or serious games, augmented and virtual reality, in ways that fundamentally change the experience of learning.These are all indications of the growing importance of digital learning. 1.7.3.Open learning Anotherincreasinglyimportantdevelopmentlinkedtoonlinelearningisthemoveto‘open’education thatoverthelast10yearshasbeguntoimpactdirectlyonconventionalinstitutions.Themostimmediate isopentextbooks–suchaswhatyouarereadingnow.Opentextbooksaredigitaltextbooksthatcanbe downloadedin adigitalformatbystudents(orinstructors)forfree,thussavingstudentsconsiderable money on textbooks. For instance, in Canada, the three provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewanarecollaboratingontheproductionanddistributionofpeer-reviewedopentextbooksfor the40high-enrolmentsubjectareasintheiruniversityandcommunitycollegeprograms.By2018nearly allpost-secondaryinstitutionsinBritishColumbia(90percent)hadadoptedatleastoneopentextbook (Bates et al,2018). Open educational resources (OER) are another recent development in open education. These are digitaleducationalmaterialsfreelyavailableovertheInternetthatcanbedownloadedbyinstructors(or students)withoutcharge,andifnecessaryadaptedoramended,underaCreativeCommonslicensethat provides protections for the creators of the material. Probably the best known source of OER is the Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyOpenCourseWare project. With individual professors’ permission,MIThasmadeavailableforfreedownloadingovertheInternetvideolecturesrecordedwith lecture capture as well as supporting materials such as slides. The implications of developments in open learning will be discussedfurther inChapter 11. 1.7.4.MOOCs OneofthemaindevelopmentsinonlinelearninghasbeentherapidgrowthofMassiveOpenOnline Courses(MOOCs).In2008, theUniversityofManitobainCanadaofferedthefirstMOOCwithjust over2,000enrolments,whichlinkedwebinarpresentationsand/orblogpostsbyexpertstoparticipants’ blogsandtweets.Thecourseswereopentoanyoneandhadnoformalassessment.In2012,twoStanford Universityprofessorslaunchedalecture-capturebasedMOOConartificialintelligence,attractingmore than 100,000 students, and since then MOOCs have expanded rapidly around the world. Although the format of MOOCs can vary, in general they have the following characteristics: • open to anyone to enroll and simple enrollment (just an e-mail address) • very large numbers (from 1,000 to 100,000) • free access to video-recorded lectures, often from the most elite universities in the USA (Harvard, MIT, Stanford in particular). • computer-based assessment, usually using multiple-choice questions and immediate feedback, combined sometimes with peer assessment • a wide range of commitment from learners: up to 50 per cent never do more than register, 25 per cent never take more than the first assignment, less than 10 per cent complete the final assessment. However, MOOCs are merely the latest example of the rapid evolution of technology, the over.enthusiasmofearlyadopters,andtheneedforcarefulanalysisofthestrengthsandweaknessesofnew technologiesforteaching.Theyareevolvingovertime,andarebeginningtofindamorelimitedbutstill important niche in the higher education market.

Yet these are the very skills needed by students in a knowledge-based society. 3. The wide diversity of the student body is a major challenge for institutions. This requiresmore focus on teaching methods that provide support for learners, more individualization of learning, and more flexible delivery. 4. Online learning is a continuum; every instructor and every institution now needs to decide: where on this continuum of teaching should a particular course or program be? 5. As more academic content becomes openly and freely available, students will look increasingly to their local institutions for support with their learning, rather than for the delivery of content. This puts a greater focus on teaching skills and less on subject expertise. 6. Faculty and instructors need a strong framework for assessing the value of different technologies, new or existing, and for deciding how or when these technologies make sense for them (and/or their students) to use. 57 Chapter 2: The nature of knowledge and the implications for teaching Thischapterdiscussestherelationshipbetweenourviewsonthenatureofknowledgeandthewaywedecide to teach. After reading this chapter you should be able to: • recognize your own epistemological/philosophical position that determines the way youare currently teaching; • reflect on the similarities or differences between academic and everyday knowledge; • decidewhether technology changes the nature of knowledge, and consider the implications for teaching; • describe in broad terms the main theories of learning and discuss their implications forteaching; • identify different levels and types of learning and decide which is most appropriate for your subject area/students; • integrate these ideas into a personal strategy or philosophy forthe teaching of your subject; • decide on whether or not to change your overall approach to teaching in the light of theissues raised in this chapter. What is covered in this chapter In this chapter, I will be discussing different beliefs about the nature of knowledge, and how that influences teaching and learning. In particular, this chapter covers the following topics: • Scenario B: A pre-dinner party discussion • 2.1: Art, theory, research, and best practices in teaching • 2.2 Epistemology and theories of learning • 2.3 Objectivism and behaviourism • 2.4 Cognitivism • 2.5 Constructivism • 2.6 Connectivism • 2.7 Is the nature of knowledge changing? 59 • 2.8 Summary Also in this chapter you will find the following activities: • Activity 2.1 What do you think makes a good teacher? • Activity 2.2 Epistemologies at a dinner party • Activity 2.3Defining the limits of behaviourism • Activity 2.4 Defining the limits of cognitivism • Activity 2.5Defining the limits of constructivism • Activity 2.6Defining the limits of connectivism • Activity 2.7 Epistemology and academic knowledge • Activity 2.8 Choosing a theory of learning 1.Teaching is a highly complex occupation, which needs to adapt to a great deal of variety in context, subject matter and learners. It does not lend itself to broad generalizations. Nevertheless it is possible to provide guidelines or principles based onbest practices, theory and research, that mustthen be adapted or modified to local conditions. 2. Our underlying beliefs and values, usually shared by other experts in a subject domain, shape our approachtoteaching.Theseunderlyingbeliefsandvaluesareoftenimplicitandareoftennotdirectlyshared withourstudents,eventhoughtheyareseenasessentialcomponentsofbecomingan‘expert’inaparticular subject domain. 3.

Inmanycases,it’s also aboutpersonalrelationships,the extenttowhichaninstructor canempathise with students or appreciatetheir difficulties in learning, and the extent to which the instructor can communicate effectively. There is also a science of teaching, based on theory and research. We shall see in fact there are many, often conflicting theories, driven primarily by epistemological differences about the nature of knowledge, and by different value systems. Then over the last 100 years there has been a great deal of empirical research into how students learn, and effective teaching methods, which at its best is driven by a strong, explicit theoretical base, and at its worseby mindless data-collection (such as RateMyProfessor). Aswell asresearch-basedpractices,there arewhatareknownasbestpractices,based onteachers’ 65 experience of teaching. While in many cases thesehave been validated by research or are driven by theories of learning, this is not always the case.As a result, what some people see asbest practices are not always universally shared by others, even if best practicesare seen in general as current acceptedwisdom.Teachingmathinprimaryschoolsinoneexample.Lecturesareanother.InChapter 3,Section3,strongevidenceisprovidedthatlectureshavemanylimitations,yetmanyinstructorsstill believe that this is the most appropriate way to teach their subject. However,eventhemostextensivelytrainedteachersdon’talwaysmakegoodteachersiftheydon’t havethetalentandemotionalconnectionwithlearners,anduntrainedteachers(whichcoversvirtually alluniversityinstructors),sometimessucceed,evenwithlittleexperience,becausetheyhaveaknackor in-borntalent.However,althoughsuchinstructorsareoftenheldupasthetriumphofartoverscience inteaching,they areinpracticevery rare.Manyoftheseuntutored,brilliantinstructorshavelearned rapidly on the job by trial and error, with the inevitable casualties along the way. Forallthesereasons,thereisnoonebestwaytoteachthatwillfitallcircumstances,whichiswhy argumentsover‘modern’or‘traditional’approachestoteachingreadingormath,forexample,areoften sosterile.Goodteachersusuallyhaveanarsenaloftools,methodsandapproachesthattheycandraw on,dependingonthecircumstances.Alsoteachersandinstructorswilldifferoverwhatconstitutesgood teaching,dependingontheirunderstandingsofwhatknowledgeis,whatmattersmostinlearning,and their priorities in terms of desirable learning outcomes. Nevertheless, these apparent contradictions do not mean that we cannot develop guidelines and techniquestoimprovethequalityofteaching,orthatwehavenoprinciplesorevidenceonwhichtobase decisionsaboutteaching,eveninarapidlychangingdigitalage.Theaimofthisbookistoprovidesuch guidelines,whilerecognizingthatonesizewillnotfitall,andthateveryteacherorinstructorwillneed to select and adapt the suggestions in this book to their own unique context. Forthisapproachtowork,though,weneedtoexploresomefundamentalissuesaboutteachingand learning, some of which are rarely addressed in everyday discussions about education.

What makes us believethatsomethingis‘true’?Questionsofthiskindareepistemologicalinnature.HoferandPintrich (1997) state: Epistemology is a branch of philosophy concerned with the nature and justification of knowledge. ThefamousargumentattheBritishAssociationin1860betweenThomasHuxleyandtheBishopof Oxford,SamuelWilberforce,overtheoriginofspeciesisaclassicexampleoftheclashbetweenbeliefs aboutthefoundationsofknowledge.WilberforcearguedthatManwascreatedbyGod;Huxleyargued that Manevolved throughnatural selection. BishopWilberforcebelievedhe was right because‘true’ knowledgewasdeterminedthroughfaithandinterpretationofholyscripture;ProfessorHuxleybelieved he was right because ‘true’ knowledge was derived through empirical science and rational skepticism. An important part of higher education is aimed at developing students’ understanding, within a particular discipline, of the criteria and values that underpin academic study of that discipline, and theseincludequestionsofwhatconstitutesvalidknowledgeinthatsubjectarea.Formanyexpertsina particularfield,theseassumptionsareoftensostrongandembeddedthattheexpertsmaynotevenbe openlyconsciousofthemunlesschallenged.Butfornovices,suchasstudents,itoftentakesagreatdeal oftime tounderstandfullytheunderlyingvalue systemsthatdrive choiceof contentandmethodsof teaching. Our epistemological position therefore has direct practical consequences for how we teach. 2.2.2Epistemology and theories of learning Mostteachersintheschool/k-12sectorwillbefamiliarwiththemaintheoriesoflearning,butbecause instructors in post-secondary educationare hired primarily for their subject experience,orresearch or vocational skills,it is essential to introduce and discuss, if only briefly, these main theories. In practice,even withoutformaltraining orknowledgeofdifferenttheoriesoflearning,allteachersand instructorswillapproachteachingwithinoneofthesemaintheoreticalapproaches,whetherornotthey areawareoftheeducationaljargonsurroundingtheseapproaches.Also,asnewtechnologiesandnew modesofteachingsuchasonlinelearning,technology-basedteaching,andinformaldigitalnetworksof learners have evolved, new theories of learning are beginning to emerge. With aknowledge of alternative theoretical approaches, teachers and instructors are in a better positiontomakechoicesabouthowtoapproachtheirteachinginwaysthatwillbestfittheperceived needsoftheirstudents,withintheverymanydifferentlearning contextsthatteachersandinstructors face.Thisisparticularlyimportantwhenaddressingmanyoftherequirementsoflearnersinadigitalage thataresetoutinChapter1.Furthermore,thechoiceoforpreferenceforaparticularepistemologyor aparticulartheoreticalapproachtoteachingwillhavemajorimplicationsforthewaythattechnologyis used to support teaching. Infact,thereisahugeamountofliteratureontheoriesoflearning,andIamawarethatthetreatment inthisbookiscursory,tosaytheleast.Thosewhowouldpreferamoredetailedintroductiontotheories oflearningshouldexploreSchunk(2016)orHarasim(2017).Theaimofmybookthoughisnottobe comprehensiveintermsofin-depthcoverageofalllearningtheories,buttoprovideabasisonwhichto suggest and evaluate different ways of teaching to meet the diverse needs of learnersin a digital age. Theimportantpointhereisthateverytheoryofteaching orlearningisunderpinnedbyaparticular assumption or understanding of what constitutes ‘true’ knowledge: in other words by a particular epistemological position.

Behaviourism is an objectivist learning theory.

Behaviouristsattempttomaintainahighdegreeofobjectivityinthewaytheyviewhumanactivity,and they generally reject reference to unmeasurable states, such as feelings, attitudes, and consciousness. Human behaviour is above all seen as predictable and controllable. Behaviourism thus stems from a strongly objectivist epistemological position. Skinner’stheoryoflearningprovidestheunderlyingtheoreticalbasisforthedevelopmentofteaching machines, measurable learning objectives, computer-assisted instruction, and multiple choice tests. It often is implicit in the application of artificial intelligence to modifying human behaviour. Behaviourism’sinfluenceisstillstrongincorporateandmilitarytraining,andinsomeareasofscience, engineering, and medical training. It can be of particular value for rote learning of facts or standard proceduressuchasmultiplicationtables,fordealingwithchildrenoradultswithlimitedcognitiveability due to brain disorders, or for compliance with industrial or business standards or processes that are invariantanddonotrequireindividualjudgement.Itisalsotheunderlyingmethodologyofsocialmedia suchasFacebookforinfluencingbehaviour,through‘likes’,numberofhitsandconnections,andother ‘status’ rewards. Behaviourism, with itsemphasis on reward and punishment as drivers of learning, and on pre.definedandmeasurableoutcomes,isthebasisofpopulistconceptionsoflearningamongmanyparents, politicians, and, it should be noted, computer scientists interested in automating learning.It is not surprising then thatthere hasalso been a tendency until recently to see technology, and in particularcomputer-aided instruction, as being closely associated with behaviourist approaches to learning,althoughweshallseeinChapter5,Section4thatcomputersdonotnecessarilyhavetobeused in a behaviourist way. Lastly, although behaviourism is an ‘objectivist’ approach to teaching, it is not the only way of teaching‘objectively’.Forinstance,problem-basedlearningcanstilltakeahighlyobjectiveapproachto knowledge and learning. References Skinner, B.

Fontana (1981) summarises the cognitive approach to learning as follows: ‘The cognitive approach … holds that if we are to understand learning we cannot confine ourselves to observable behaviour, but must also concern ourselves with the learner’s ability mentally to re.organize his psychological field (i.e. his inner world of concepts, memories, etc.) in response to 75 experience. This latter approach therefore lays stress not only on the environment, but upon the way in which the individual interprets and tries to make sense of the environment. It sees the individual not as the somewhat mechanical product of his environment, but as an active agent in the learning process, deliberately trying to process and categorize the stream of information fed into him by the external world.’ (p. 148) Thusthesearchforrules,principles orrelationshipsinprocessing newinformation,andthesearch formeaningandconsistencyinreconcilingnewinformationwithpreviousknowledge,arekeyconcepts in cognitive psychology. Cognitive psychology is concerned with identifying and describing mental processes that affect learning,thinkingandbehaviour, andtheconditionsthatinfluencethosemental processes. 2.4.2Cognitivist learning theory ThemostwidelyusedtheoriesofcognitivismineducationarebasedonBloom’staxonomiesoflearning objectives (Bloom et al., 1956), which are related to the development of different kinds of learning skills,orwaysoflearning.Bloomandhiscolleaguesclaimedthattherearethreeimportantdomainsof learning: • cognitive (thinking) • affective (feeling) • psycho-motor (doing). Cognitivismfocusesonthe‘thinking’domain.Inmorerecentyears,AndersonandKrathwohl(2000) have slightly modifiedBloom et al.’s original taxonomy, adding‘creating’ new knowledge: Figure 2.4.2 Cognitive domain Image: © Atherton J S (2013) CC-NC-ND Bloometal.alsoarguedthatthereisahierarchyoflearning,meaningthatlearnersneedtoprogress through each of the levels, from rememberingthrough to evaluating/creating. As psychologists delve deeperintoeachofthesecognitiveactivitiestounderstandtheunderlyingmentalprocesses,itbecomes an increasingly reductionist exercise (see Figure 2.4.3 below). 2.4.3Applications of cognitivist learning theory Cognitive approaches to learning, with afocus on comprehension, abstraction, analysis, synthesis, generalization, evaluation, decision-making, problem-solving and creative thinking,seem to fit much better withhigher education thanbehaviourism, but even in school/k-12 education, a cognitivist approachwould meanforinstancefocusing onteachinglearnershow tolearn,ondevelopingstronger ornewmentalprocesses forfuture learning, andon developingdeeper and constantly changing understanding of concepts and ideas. Cognitive approaches to learning cover a very wide range. At the objectivist end, cognitivists considerbasic mental processes to begenetic or hard-wired, but can be programmed or modified by externalfactors,suchasnewexperiences.Earlycognitivistsinparticularwereinterestedintheconcept ofmindascomputer,andmorerecentlybrainresearchhasled toasearchforlinkingcognitiontothe development and reinforcement of neural networks in the brain. In terms of practice, this concept of mind as computer has led to several technology-based developments in teaching, including: • intelligent tutoring systems, a more refined version of teaching machines, based on breaking down learning intoa series of manageable steps, and analysing learners’ responses to direct themto the most appropriate next step. Adaptive learning is the latest extension of such developments; • artificial intelligence, which seeks to represent in computer software the mental processes used in human learning (which of course if successful would result incomputersreplacing many human activities – such as teaching, if learning is considered in an objectivist framework); • pre-determined learning outcomes, based on an analysis and development of different kinds of cognitive activities, such as comprehension, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation; • problem-based learning, based on an analysis of the thinking processessuccessful problem-solvers use to solve problems; • instructional design approaches that attempt to manage the design of teaching to ensure successful achievement of pre-determined learning outcomes or objectives. Cognitivists haveincreasedourunderstanding of how humansprocess and make sense of new information, how we access, interpret, integrate, process, organize and manage knowledge, and have given us a better understanding ofthe conditions that affect learners’mental states. References Anderson,L.andKrathwohl,D.(eds.)(2001).

However, constructivists emphasisethe importance of consciousness, free will and social influences on learning. Carl Rogers (1969) stated that: every individual exists in a continually changing world of experience in which he is the center. 81 Theexternalworldisinterpretedwithinthecontextofthatprivateworld.Thebeliefthathumansare essentiallyactive,freeandstriveformeaninginpersonaltermshasbeenaroundforalongtime,andis an essential component of constructivism. Constructivists believe that knowledge is essentially subjective in nature, constructed from our perceptionsandmutuallyagreeduponconventions.Accordingtothisview,weconstructnewknowledge ratherthansimplyacquireitviamemorizationorthroughtransmissionfromthosewhoknowtothose who don’tknow. Constructivists believe that meaning or understanding is achievedby assimilating information,relatingittoourexistingknowledge,andcognitivelyprocessingit(inotherwords,thinking or reflecting on new information).Social constructivists believe that this process works best through discussion and social interaction, allowing us to test and challenge our own understandings with thoseofothers.For aconstructivist, evenphysicallawsexistbecausetheyhavebeenconstructed by peoplefromevidence,observation,anddeductiveorintuitivethinking,and,mostimportantly,because certaincommunitiesofpeople(inthisexample,scientists)havemutuallyagreedwhatconstitutesvalid knowledge. Constructivists argue that individuals consciously strive for meaning to make sense of their environmentintermsofpastexperienceandtheirpresentstate.Itisanattempttocreateorderintheir mindsoutofdisorder,toresolveincongruities,andtoreconcileexternalrealitieswithpriorexperience.

Thus behaviour is not predictable or deterministic, at least not at the individual level(which is a key distinguishing feature from cognitivism, which seeks general rules of thinking thatapply toallhumans).Thekeypointhereisthatforconstructivists,learningisseenasessentially asocial process, requiring communication between learner, teacher and others. This social process cannot effectively be replaced by technology, although technology may facilitate it. 2.5.2Constructivist approaches to teaching Formanyeducators,thesocialcontextoflearningiscritical.Ideasaretestednotjustontheteacher,but withfellowstudents,friendsandcolleagues.Furthermore,knowledgeismainlyacquiredthroughsocial processesorinstitutionsthataresociallyconstructed:schools,universities,andincreasinglythesedays, online communities. Thus what is taken to be ‘valued’ knowledge is also socially constructed. Constructivistsbelievethatlearningis aconstantlydynamicprocess.Understandingofconcepts or principlesdevelopsandbecomesdeeperovertime.Forinstance,asaveryyoungchild,weunderstand the concept of heat through touch. As we get older we realise that it can be quantified, such as minus 20 centigrade being very cold (unless you live in Manitoba, where -20Cwould be considered normal). As we study science, we begin to understand heat differently, for instance,as a form of energytransfer,thenasaformofenergyassociatedwiththemotionofatomsormolecules.Each‘new’ component needs to be integrated with prior understandings and also integrated with other related concepts, including other components of molecular physics andchemistry. Thus ‘constructivist’ teachers place a strong emphasis on learners developing personal meaning throughreflection,analysisandthegradualbuildingoflayersordepthsofknowledgethroughconscious andongoingmentalprocessing.Reflection,seminars,discussionforums,smallgroupwork,andprojects arekeymethodsused tosupportconstructivistlearningincampus-basedteaching(discussedin more detail in Chapter 3), and online collaborative learning, and communities of practice are importantconstructivist methods in online learning (Chapter 4). Althoughproblem-solvingcanbeapproachedinanobjectivistway,bypre-determiningasetofsteps or processes to go through pre-determined by ‘experts’, it can also be approached in a constructivist manner.Thelevelofteacherguidance canvaryin aconstructivistapproach toproblem-solving,from noneatall,toprovidingsomeguidelinesonhowtosolvetheproblem,todirectingstudentstopossible sourcesofinformationthatmayberelevant tosolvingthatproblem,to gettingstudents tobrainstorm particularsolutions.Studentswillprobablyworkingroups,helpeachotherandcomparesolutionstothe problem.Theremaynotbeconsideredone‘correct’solutiontotheproblem,butthegroupmayconsider some solutions better than others, depending on the agreed criteria of success for solving the problem. Itcanbeseenthatthere canbe‘degrees’ofconstructivism,sinceinpracticetheteachermaywell act as first among equals, and help direct the process so that ‘suitable’ outcomes are achieved. The fundamentaldifferenceisthatstudentshavetoworktowardsconstructingtheirownmeaning,testingit against ‘reality’, and further constructing meaning as a result. Constructivists also approach technology for teachingdifferently from behaviourists. From a constructivist perspective, brains have more plasticity, adaptability and complexity than current computer software programs.Other uniquely human factors, such as emotion, motivation, free will,values,andawiderrangeofsenses,makehumanlearningverydifferentfromthewaycomputers operate.Followingthisreasoning,educationwouldbemuchbetterservedifcomputerscientiststriedto makesoftwaretosupportlearningmorereflectiveofthewayhumanlearningoperates,ratherthantrying tofithumanlearningintothecurrentrestrictionsofbehaviouristcomputerprogramming.Thiswillbe discussed in more detail inChapter 4, Section 4. Although constructivist approaches can be and have been applied to all fields of knowledge, they aremorecommonlyfoundinapproachestoteachinginthehumanities,socialsciences,education,and other less quantitative subject areas. References Rogers, C.

Connections form naturally, through a process of association, and are not “constructed” through some sort of intentional action. …Hence, in connectivism, there is no real concept of transferring knowledge, making knowledge, or building knowledge. Rather, the activities we undertake when we conduct practices in order to learn are more like growing or developing ourselves and our society in certain (connected) ways. Figure 2.6.3: A map of connectivism Image: © pkab.wordpress.com. Click and drag for a larger image. 2.6.2Connectivism and learning ForSiemens (2005), it is the connections and the way information flows that result in knowledge existingbeyondtheindividual.Learningbecomestheabilitytotapintosignificantflowsofinformation, and to follow those flows that are significant.Heargues that: Connectivism presents a model of learning that acknowledges the tectonic shifts in society where learning is no longer an internal, individualistic activity….Learning (defined as actionable knowledge) can reside outside of ourselves (within an organization or a database). Siemens (2005)identifies the principles ofconnectivism as follows: • Learning and knowledge rests in diversity of opinions. • Learning is a process of connecting specialized nodes or information sources. • Learning may reside in non-human appliances. • Capacity to know more is more critical than what is currently known • Nurturing and maintaining connections is needed to facilitate continual learning. • Ability to see connections between fields, ideas, and concepts is a core skill. • Currency (accurate, up-to-date knowledge) is the intent of all connectivist learning activities. • Decision-making is itself a learning process. Choosing what to learn and the meaning of incoming information is seen through the lens of a shifting reality. While there is a right answer now, it may be wrong tomorrow due to alterations in the information climate affecting the decision. Downes (2007)states that: at its heart, connectivism is the thesis that knowledge is distributed across a network of connections, and therefore that learning consists of the ability to construct and traverse those networks….[Connectivism] implies a pedagogy that: (a) seeks to describe ‘successful’ networks (as identified by their properties, which I have characterized as diversity, autonomy, openness, and connectivity) and (b) seeks to describe the practices that lead to such networks, both in the individual and in society – which I have characterized as modelling and demonstration (on the part of a teacher) – and practice and reflection (on the part of a learner). 2.6.3Applications of connectivism to teaching and learning Siemens,DownesandCormierconstructedthefirstmassiveopenonlinecourse(MOOC),Connectivism and Connective Knowledge 2011, partly to explain and partly to model a connectivist approach to learning. Connectivists such asSiemens and Downes tend to be somewhat vague aboutthe role of teachers orinstructors,asthefocusofconnectivismis moreonindividualparticipants,networksandtheflow ofinformationandthenew formsofknowledgethatresult.Themainpurposeof ateacherappears to beto providethe initiallearningenvironmentandcontextthatbringslearnerstogether, and tohelp learnersconstructtheirownpersonallearningenvironmentsthatenablethemtoconnectto‘successful’ networks,withthe assumption thatlearning willautomatically occurasa result,throughexposure to theflowofinformationandtheindividual’sautonomousreflectiononitsmeaning.Thereisnoneedfor formalinstitutionstosupportthiskindoflearning,especiallysincesuchlearningoftendependsheavily on social media readily available to all participants. Therearenumerouscriticismsoftheconnectivistapproachtoteachingandlearning(seeChapter5, Section4).Someofthesecriticismsmaybeovercomeaspracticeimproves,asnewtoolsforassessment, and for organizing co-operative and collaborative work with massive numbers, are developed, and asmore experience isgained.Moreimportantly, connectivismisreally thefirst theoretical attemptto radically re-examinethe implications forlearning of the Internet and the explosion of new communications technologies. References and further reading AlDahdouh, A., et al.

They argue that ‘important’ or ‘valid’ knowledge now is different from prior forms of knowledge,particularlyacademicknowledge.Downes(2007)hasarguedthat newtechnologiesallow for the de-institutionalisation of learning. Chris Anderson, the editor of Wired Magazine and now Curator of Ted Talks, has argued (2008) that massive meta-data correlations can replace ‘traditional’ scientific approaches to creating new knowledge: Google’sfoundingphilosophyisthatwedon’tknowwhythispageisbetterthanthatone:Ifthestatisticsof incoming linkssay it is, that’s good enough. Nosemantic or causal analysisis required.…This is a world where massive amounts of data and applied mathematics replace every other toolthat mightbe brought to bear.Outwitheverytheoryofhumanbehavior,fromlinguisticstosociology.Forgettaxonomy,ontology,and psychology.Whoknowswhypeopledowhattheydo?Thepointistheydoit,andwecantrackandmeasureit with unprecedented fidelity. With enough data, the numbers speak for themselves. The big target here isn’t advertising, though. It’s science. The scientific method is built around testable hypotheses.Thesemodels,forthemostpart,aresystemsvisualizedinthemindsofscientists.Themodelsare thentested,andexperimentsconfirm orfalsifytheoreticalmodelsofhowtheworldworks.Thisistheway sciencehasworkedforhundredsofyears.Scientistsaretrainedtorecognizethatcorrelationisnotcausation, thatnoconclusionsshouldbedrawnsimply onthebasisofcorrelationbetweenXandY(itcouldjustbe a coincidence).Instead,youmustunderstandtheunderlyingmechanismsthatconnectthetwo.Onceyouhave amodel,you canconnectthedata setswithconfidence.Datawithout amodelisjustnoise.Butfacedwith massive data, this approach to science — hypothesize, model, test — is becoming obsolete.’ (It should be noted this was written before derivative-based investments caused financial markets to collapse, mainly because those using them didn’t understand the underlying logic that created the data.) JaneGilbert’sbook,‘CatchingtheKnowledgeWave’(2005),directlyaddressestheassumptionthat the nature of knowledge is changing. Drawing on publications byManuel Castells(2009) andJean-François Lyotard(1984), she writes (p. 35): ‘Castellssaysthat…knowledgeisnotanobjectbutaseriesofnetworksandflows…thenewknowledgeisa processnotaproduct…itisproducednotinthemindsofindividualsbutintheinteractionsbetweenpeople….. AccordingtoLyotard,thetraditionalideathatacquiringknowledgetrainsthemindwouldbecomeobsolete, as would the idea of knowledge as a set of universal truths. Instead, there will be many truths, many knowledges and many forms of reason. As a result… the boundaries between traditional disciplines are dissolving,traditionalmethodsofrepresentingknowledge(books,academicpapers,andsoon)arebecoming less important, and the role of traditional academics or experts are undergoing major change.’ Back in the 1960sMarshall McLuhan (1964) argued that the medium is the message; the way information is represented and transmitted is changed and so is our focus and understanding as informationmoves between and withindifferent media. If information and knowledge arenow representedandmoresignificantlynowflowdifferently,howdoesthataffecteducationalprocessessuch as teaching and learning? Onewayknowledgeiscertainlychangingisinthewayitisrepresented.Itshouldberememberedthat Socrates(accordingtoPlato)criticisedwritingbecauseitcouldnotleadto‘true’knowledgewhichcame onlyfromverbaldialogueandoratory.Writinghoweverisimportantbecauseitprovidesapermanent recordofknowledge.Theprintingpresswasimportantbecauseitenabledthewrittenwordtospreadto manymorepeople.Asaconsequence,scholarscouldchallengeandbetterinterpret,throughreflection, whatothershadwritten,and moreaccuratelyandcarefully arguetheir ownpositions.Manyscholars believethatoneconsequenceofthedevelopmentofmassprintingwastheRenaissanceandtheageof enlightenment, and modern academia consequently came to depend very heavily on the print medium. Nowwehaveotherwaystorecordandtransmitknowledgethatcanbestudiedandreflectedupon, suchasvideo,audio,animations,andgraphics,andtheInternetdoesexpandenormouslythespeedand rangebywhichtheserepresentationsofknowledgecanbetransmitted.WeshallalsoseeinChapter8 and Chapter 9that that media are not neutral, but represent meaning in different ways. 2.7.2Knowledge as a commodity All theaboveauthors agree that the ‘new’ knowledge in the knowledge society is about the commercialisationorcommodificationofknowledge:‘itisdefinednotthroughwhatitis,butthrough whatitcando.’(Gilbert,p.35).‘Thecapacitytoown,buyandsellknowledgehascontributed,inmajor ways, to the development of the new, knowledge-based societies.’ (p.39) In a knowledge-based society, particular emphasis is placed on the utility of knowledge for commercial purposes. As a result there ismore emphasis on certain types of immediately practical knowledgeoverlongertermresearch,forinstance,butbecauseofthestrongrelationshipbetweenpure and applied knowledge, this isprobably a mistake, even in terms of economic development. Theissueisnotsomuchthenatureofknowledge,buthowstudentsorlearnerscometoacquirethat knowledge and learn how it can be used. As I argued in Chapter 1, this requires more emphasis on developingandlearningskillsofhowbesttoapplyknowledge,ratherthanafocusonmerelyteaching content.Alsoitwillbearguedlaterinthebookthatstudentshavemanymoresourcesofinformation besidestheteacherorinstructorandthatakeyeducationalissueisthemanagementofvastamountsof knowledge.Sinceknowledgeisdynamic,expandingandconstantlychanging,learnersneedtodevelop the skills and learn to use the tools that will enable them to continue to learn. Butdoesthis mean that knowledgeitself is now different? Iwill arguethat in a digital age, some aspectsofknowledgedochangeconsiderably,butothersdonot,atleastinessence.Inparticular,Iargue thatacademicknowledge,intermsofitsvaluesandgoals,doesnotandshouldnotchangeagreatdeal, but the way it is represented and applied will and should change. 2.7.3The nature of academic knowledge Academic knowledge is a specific form of knowledge that has characteristics that differentiate it from other kinds of knowledge, and particularly from knowledge or beliefs based solely on direct personalexperience.Insummary,academicknowledgeisasecond-orderformofknowledgethatseeks abstractions and generalizations based on reasoning and evidence. Fundamental components of academic knowledge are • transparency, • codification, • reproduction, and • communicability. Transparency meansthatthe sourceoftheknowledge canbetracedandverified.Codification means thattheknowledgecanbeconsistentlyrepresentedinsomeform(words,symbols,video)thatenables interpretation by someone other than the originator. Knowledge can be reproduced or have multiple copies.Lastly,knowledgemustbeinaformsuchthatitcanbecommunicatedandchallengedbyothers. Laurillard(2001)recognisestheimportanceofrelatingthestudent’sdirectexperienceoftheworldto anunderstandingofacademicconceptsandprocesses,butshearguesthatteachingatauniversitylevel mustgobeyonddirectexperience toreflection,analysisandexplanationsofthosedirectexperiences. Becauseeveryacademicdisciplinehasaspecificsetofconventionsandassumptionsaboutthenature ofknowledgewithinitsdiscipline,studentsinhighereducationneedtochangetheperspectivesoftheir everyday experience to match those of the subject domain. Asaresult,Laurillardarguesthatuniversityteachingis‘essentiallyarhetoricalactivity,persuading students to change the way they experience the world’ (p.28). Laurillard then goes on to make the pointthatbecauseacademicknowledgehasthissecond-ordercharacter, itreliesheavily onsymbolic representation, such as language, mathematical symbols, ‘or any symbol system that can represent a description of the world, and requires interpretation’ (p.27) to enable this mediation to take place. Ifacademicknowledgerequiresmediation,thenthishasmajorsignificancefortheuseoftechnology. Language(i.e.readingandspeaking)isonlyonechannelformediatingknowledge.Mediasuchasvideo, audio, and computing can also provide teachers with alternative channels of mediation. Laurillard’sreflectionsonthenatureofacademicknowledgeareacounter-balancetotheviewthat students can automatically construct knowledge through argument and discussion with their peers, orself-directed study, or the wisdom of the crowd. For academic knowledge, the role of the teacher is to help students understand not just the facts or concepts in a subject discipline, but the rules and conventionsforacquiringandvalidatingknowledgewithinthatsubjectdiscipline.Academicknowledge shares common values or criteria, making academic knowledge itself a particular epistemological approach. 2.7.4 Academic versus applied knowledge In a knowledge-based society, knowledge that leads to innovation and commercial activity is now recognisedascriticaltoeconomicdevelopment. Again,thereis atendency toarguethatthiskindof knowledge – ‘commercial’ knowledge – is different from academic knowledge. I would argue that sometimes it is and sometimes it isn’t. Ihavenoargumentwiththepointofviewthatknowledgeisthedriverofmostmoderneconomies, andthatthisrepresentsamajorshiftfromthe‘old’industrialeconomy,wherenaturalresources(coal, oil,iron),machineryandcheapmanuallabourwerethepredominantdrivers.Idothoughchallengethe idea that thenature ofknowledge has undergone radical changes. ThedifficultyIhavewiththebroadgeneralisationsaboutthechangingnature ofknowledgeisthat therehavealways beendifferentkindsofknowledge.OneofmyfirstjobswasinabreweryintheEast EndofLondonin1959.I wasoneofseveralstudentshiredduring oursummervacation.Oneofmy fellowstudentworkers was abrilliantmathematician.

Itis too narrow a definition, because it thus excludes all the professionalschools and disciplines, such as engineering, medicine, law, business,education that ‘apply’academicknowledge.Thesearejustasacceptedand‘valued’partsofuniversitiesandcolleges asthe‘pure’disciplinesofhumanitiesandscience,andtheiractivitiesmeetallthecriteriaforacademic knowledge set out by Gilbert. Makingadistinctionbetweenacademicandappliedknowledgemissestherealpointaboutthekind ofeducationneededinaknowledgesocietyandadigitalage.Itisnotjustknowledge–bothpureand applied–thatisimportant,butalsodigitalliteracy,skillsassociatedwithlifelonglearning,andattitudes/ ethics and social behaviour. Knowledgeisnotjust‘stuff’,orfixedcontent,butitisdynamic.Knowledgeisalsonotjust‘flow’.

However, it has been the explosion in academicknowledgethathasformedthebasisoftheknowledgesociety.Itwasacademicdevelopment insciences,medicineandengineeringthatledtothedevelopmentoftheInternet,biotechnology,digital financialservices,computersoftwareandtelecommunications,forexample.Indeed,itisnocoincidence that those countries most advanced in knowledge-based industries were those that have the highest participation rates in university education. Thus whileacademic knowledge is not ‘pure’ or timeless or objectively ‘true’, it is the principles or values that drive academic knowledge that are important. Although it often falls short, the goal ofacademicstudiesis toreachfordeepunderstanding,generalprinciples,empirically-basedtheories, timelessness, etc.,even if knowledge is dynamic, changing and constantly evolving. Academic knowledgeisnotperfect,butdoeshavevaluebecauseofthestandardsitrequires.Norhaveacademic knowledge or methods run out of steam. There isevidence all around us: academic knowledge is generatingnewdrugtreatments,newunderstandingsofclimatechange,bettertechnology,andcertainly new knowledge generation. Indeed, more than ever, we need to sustain the elements of academic knowledge, such as rigour, abstraction,evidence-basedgeneralisation,empiricalevidence,rationalismandacademicindependence. Itistheseelementsofeducationthathaveenabledtherapideconomicgrowthbothintheindustrialand theknowledgesocieties.Thedifferencenowisthattheseelementsalonearenotenough;theyneedtobe combined with new approaches to teaching and learning. 2.7.6Academic knowledge and other forms of knowledge As mentioned earlier, there are many other forms of knowledge that are useful or valued besides academicknowledge.Thereisincreasingemphasisfromgovernmentandbusinessonthedevelopment of vocational or trades skills. Teachers or instructors are responsible for developing these areas of knowledge as well. In particular, skills that require manual dexterity, performance skills in music or drama,productionskillsinentertainment,skillsinsportorsportsmanagement,areallexamplesofforms of knowledge that have not traditionally been considered ‘academic’. However,onefeatureofadigitalsocietyisthatincreasinglythesevocationalskillsarenowrequiring amuchhigherproportionofacademicknowledgeorintellectualandconceptualknowledgeaswellas performanceskills.Forexamplehigherlevelsofabilityinmathand/orsciencearenowdemandedof manytradesandprofessionssuch asnetworkengineers,powerengineers, automechanics, nursesand other health professionals.

It does not lend itself to broad generalizations. Nevertheless it is possible to provide guidelines or principles based onbest practices, theory and research, that mustthen be adapted or modified to local conditions. 2. Our underlying beliefs and values, usually shared by other experts in a subject domain, shape our approachtoteaching.Theseunderlyingbeliefsandvaluesareoftenimplicitandareoftennotdirectlyshared withourstudents,eventhoughtheyareseenasessentialcomponentsofbecomingan‘expert’inaparticular subject domain. 3. It is argued that academic knowledge is different from other forms of knowledge, and is even more relevant today in a digital age. 4.However,academicknowledgeisnottheonlykindofknowledgethatisimportantintoday’ssociety,and asteacherswehavetobeawareofotherformsofknowledgeandtheirpotentialimportancetoourstudents, andmake sure that we are providing the full range of contents and skills needed for students in a digital age. Chapter 3: Methods of teaching: campus-focused This chapter discusses a selection of teaching methods that areoften used in a campus-based learning environment. When you have read this chapter you should be able to: • describe several different methodsof teaching used in campus-based teaching; • discuss the general strengths and weaknesses of each approach; • identify the extent to which each approach meets the needs of learners in a digital age; • choose an appropriate teaching method (or mix of methods) for your teaching context. What is covered in this chapter Fiveperspectivesonteachingareexaminedandrelatedtoepistemologiesandtheoriesoflearning,with aparticularemphasisontheirrelevancetoadigitalage.Inparticularthischaptercoversthefollowing topics: • ScenarioC: A stats lecturer fights the system • 3.1 Five perspectives on teaching • 3.2 The origins of the classroom design model • 3.3 Transmissive lectures: learning by listening • 3.4 Interactive lectures, seminars, and tutorials: learning by talking • 3.5 Learning by doing: Experiential learning • 3.6 Learning by doing: Apprenticeship • 3.7 Learning by being: The nurturing and social reform models of teaching • 3.8 Main conclusions Also in this chapter you will find the following activities: • Activity 3.1 There is no activity for this section • Activity 3.2 Thinking outside the [classroom] box • Activity 3.3 The future of lectures • Activity 3.4 Developing conceptual learning • Activity 3.5 Assessing experiential design models • Activity 3.6Applying apprenticeship to university teaching • Activity 3.7 Nurturing, social reform and connectivism • Activity 3.8 ‘Labelling’ your own teaching 101 Mostinstructorswillmixandmatchdifferentmethods,dependingontheneedsofboththesubjectmatter andtheneedsoftheirstudentsataparticulartime.Therearethoughsomecoreconclusionstobedrawnfrom this comparative review of different approaches to teaching. 1. No single method is likely to meet all the requirements teachers face in a digital age. 2. Nevertheless, some forms of teaching fit better with the development of the skills needed in a digital age. In particular, methods that focus on conceptual development, such as dialogue and discussion, knowledge management, and experiential learning in real-world contexts are more likely to develop the high level conceptual skills required in a digital age, rather than information transmission. 3. It is not just conceptual skills though that are needed. It is the combination of conceptual, practical, personal and socialskills in highly complex situations that are needed. This again means combining a variety of teaching methods. 4. Nearly allof these teaching methods are media or technology independent. In other words, they can be used in classrooms or online. What matters from a learning perspective is not so much the choice of technologyas the efficacy and expertise in appropriately choosing and using the teaching method. 5. Nevertheless, we shall see in the next chapterthat new technologies offer new possibilities for teaching, including offering more practice or time on task, reaching out to new target groups, and increasing the productivity of both teachers and the system as a whole. Figure 3 C Image: Verywellmind.com Clive (looking carefully at his partner, Jean): So what went wrong at work today?

Francis Fukuyama, in his monumental writingon political development and political decay (2011, 2014), points out that institutions that provide essential functions within a state often become so fixed over time intheir originalstructuresthattheyfail toadaptandadjust tochangesintheexternalenvironment.We need thereforetoexamineinparticularthe rootsofourmoderneducationalsystems,becauseteachingand learninginthepresentdayisstillstronglyinfluencedbyinstitutionalstructuresdevelopedmanyyears ago.Thus, weneedtoexamine the extenttowhich ourtraditional campus-basedmodelsofteaching remain fit for a digital age. The large urban school, college or university, organized by age stratification, learners meeting in groups, and regulated units of time, was an excellent fit for an industrialsociety. In many ways it 107 matched the waywork was organised in factories. In effect, we still have a predominantly industrial model of educational design, which in large part remains our default design model even today. Somedesignmodelsaresoembeddedintraditionandconventionthatweareoftenlikefishinwater –wejustacceptthatthisistheenvironmentinwhichwehavetoliveandbreath.Theclassroommodel isaverygoodexampleofthis.Inaclassroombasedmodel,learnersareorganisedinclassesthatmeet onaregularbasisatthesameplaceatcertaintimesofthedayforagivenlengthoftimeoveragiven period (a term or semester). This is a design decision that wastaken more than 150 years ago. It was embedded in the social, economic and political context of the 19th century. This context included: • the industrialization of society which provided ‘models’ for organizing both work and labour, such as factories and mass production; • the movement of people from rural to urban occupations and communities,with increased density resulting inlarger institutions; • the move tomass education to meetthe needs of industrialemployers and an increasingly large and complex range of state-managed activities, such as government, health and education; • voter enfranchisement and hence the need fora better educated voting public; • over time, demand for more equality, resulting in universal access to education. However, over the span of 150 years, our society has slowly changed.

The term ‘lecture’ comes from the Latin, meaning a reading. In the 13th century, most books were extremely rare. They were painstakingly handcrafted and illustrated by monks, often from fragments or collections of earlier and exceedingly rare and valuable scrolls from ancient Greek or Roman times, or were translated from Arabic sources, sincemuch documentation was destroyed in Europeduring the Dark Ages following the fall of the Roman empire. As a result,a university would often have only one copy of a book, and it may have been the only copy available in the world. The library and its collection therefore became critical to the reputation of a university, andprofessors had to borrow the only text from the library and literally read from it to the students, who dutifully wrote down their own version of the lecture. Lecturesthemselvesbelongtoanevenlongeroraltraditionoflearning,whereknowledgeispassed onbywordofmouthfromonegenerationtothenext.Insuchcontexts,accuracyandauthority(orpower incontrollingaccesstoknowledge)arecriticalfor‘accepted’knowledgetobesuccessfullytransmitted.

Now, I cannot see that lectures can do as much good as reading the books from which the lectures are taken…Lectures were once useful, but now, when all can read, and books are so numerous, lectures are unnecessary.’ Boswell, 1791 What is remarkable is that even afterthe invention of theprinting press, radio, television, andthe Internet, the transmissive lecture, characterised by the authoritative instructortalking to a group of students,stillremainsthedominantmethodologyforteachinginmanyinstitutions,eveninadigitalage, whereinformationisavailableataclickofamouse.Itcouldbearguedthatanythingthathaslastedthis longmusthavesomethinggoingforit.Ontheotherhand,weneedtoquestionwhetherthetransmissive lectureisstillthe mostappropriatemeansofteaching,givenallthechangesthathavetakenplacein recent years, and in particular given the kinds of knowledge and skills needed in a digital age. 3.3.3 What does research tell us about the effectiveness of lectures? WhateveryoumaythinkofSamuelJohnson’sopinion,therehasindeedbeen agreatdealofresearch into the effectiveness of lectures, going back to the 1960s, and continued through until today. The mostauthoritativeanalysisoftheresearchontheeffectivenessoflecturesremainsBligh’s(2000).He summarizedawiderangeofmeta-analysesandstudiesoftheeffectivenessoflecturescomparedwith other teaching methods and found consistent results: • the lecture is as effective as other methods for transmitting information (the corollary of course is that other methods – such as video, reading, independent study, or Wikipedia –are just as effective as lecturing for transmitting information); • most lectures are not as effective as discussion for promoting thought; • lectures are generally ineffective for changing attitudes or values or for inspiring interest in a subject; • lectures are relatively ineffective for teaching behavioural skills. Blighalsoexaminedresearch onstudentattention,onmemorizing,andonmotivation,andconcluded (p.56): ‘We see evidence… once again to suppose that lectures should not be longer than twenty to thirty minutes – at least without techniques to vary stimulation.‘ These research studies have shown that inorder to understand, analyze, apply, and commit information to long-term memory, the learner must actively engage with the material. In order for a lecture to be effective, it must include activities that compel the student to mentally manipulate the information. Many lecturers of course do this, by stopping and asking for comments or questions throughout the lecture – but many do not. Again,althoughthesefindingshavebeenavailablefor alongtime,andYou Tubevideos nowlast approximatelyeightminutesandTEDtalks20minutes atamaximum,teachinginmanyeducational institutionsisstillorganizedaroundastandard50minutelecturesessionorlonger,with,ifstudentsare lucky,afewminutesattheendforquestionsordiscussion.Therearetwoimportantconclusionsfrom the research: • even for the sole purpose for which lectures may be effective – the transmission of information – the 50 minute lecture needs to be well organized, with frequent opportunities for student questions and discussion (Bligh provides excellent suggestions on how to do this in his book); • for all other important learning activities, such as developing critical thinking, deep understanding, and application of knowledge – the kind of skills needed in a digital age – lectures are ineffective. Other forms of teaching and learning – such as opportunities for discussion and student activities – are necessary. 3.3.4 Does new technology make lectures more relevant? Overtheyears,institutionshavemademassiveinvestmentsinaddingtechnologiestosupportlecturing.

One example isan inaugural lecture I attended for a newly appointedresearchprofessor.Inthislecture,theprofessorsummarisedalltheresearchheandhisteam haddone,resultingintreatmentsforseveralcancersandotherdiseases.Thiswasapubliclecture,sohe hadtosatisfynotonlyotherleadingresearchersinthearea,butalsoalaypublicwithoftennoscience background.Hedidthisbyusingexcellentvisualsandanalogies.Thelecturewasfollowedbyasmall wine and cheese reception for the audience. The lecture worked for several reasons: • first of all, it was a celebratory occasion bring together family, colleagues and friends; • second, it was an opportunity to pull together nearly 20 years of research into a single, coherent narrative or story; • third, the lecture was well supported by an appropriate use of graphics and video; • lastly, he put a great deal of work into preparing this lecture and thinking about who would be in the audience – much more preparation than would have been the case if this was just one of many lectures in a course. McKeachie and Svinicki (2006, p. 58) believe that lecturing is best used for: • providing up-to-date material that can’t be found in one source; • summarizing material found in a variety of sources; • adapting material to the interests of a particular group; • initially helping students discover key concepts, principles or ideas; • modelling expert thinking. Thelastpointisimportant.Facultyoftenarguethattherealvalueofalectureistoprovideamodelfor studentsofhowthefacultymember, asanexpert,approaches atopicorproblem.Thustheimportant pointofthelectureisnotthetransmissionofcontent(facts,principles,ideas),whichthestudentscould getfromjustreading,butanexpertwayofthinkingaboutthetopic.Thetroublewiththisargumentfor lectures is three-fold: • students are rarely aware that this is the purpose of the lecture, and therefore focus on memorizing the content, rather than the ‘modelling’ of expert thinking; • faculty themselves are not explicit about how they are doing the modelling (or fail to offer other ways in which modelling could be used, so students can compare and contrast); • students get no practice themselves in modelling this skill, even if they are aware of the modelling. Perhapsmoreimportantly,lookingatMcKeachieandSvinicki’ssuggestions,woulditnotbebetterfor the students, rather than the lecturer, to be doing these activities in a digital age? So,yes,thereareafewoccasionswhenlecturesworkverywell.Butinadigitalagetheyshouldnot bethedefaultmodelforregularteaching.Therearemuchbetterwaystoteachthatwillresultinbetter learning over the length of a course or program. 3.3.6 Why are lectures still the main form of educational delivery? Givenalloftheabove,someexplanationneedstobeofferedforthepersistenceofthelectureintothe 21st century. Here are somesuggestions: • in fact, in many areas of education, the lecturehas been replaced, particularly in many elementary or primary schools; • architectural inertia: a huge investment has been made by institutions in facilities that support the lecture model. What is to happen to all that real estate if it is not used? (As Winston Churchill said, ‘We shape our buildings and our buildings shape us‘); • in North America, the Carnegie unit of teaching, which is based on a notion of onehour per week of classroom time per credit over a 13 week period. It is easy then to divide a three credit course into 39one hour lectures over which the curriculum for the course must be covered. It is on this basis that teaching load and resources are decided; • faculty in post-secondary education have no other model for teaching. This is the model they are used to, and because appointment is based on training in research or work experience, and not on qualifications in teaching, they have no knowledge of how students learn or confidence or experience in othermethods of teaching; • many expertsprefer the oral tradition of teaching and learning,because it enhances their status as an expert and source of knowledge; being allowed an hour of other people’s time to hear your ideas without major interruption is very satisfying on a personal level (at least for me when I’m lecturing); • seeScenario Cat the start of this chapter. 3.3.7Is there a future for lectures in a digital age? Thatdependsonhowfarintothefutureonewantstolook.Giventheinertiainthesystem,lecturesare likelystilltopredominateforanothertenyears,butafterthat,inmostinstitutions,coursesbasedonthree lectures a week over 13 weeks will have disappeared. There are several reasons for this: • all content can be easily digitalized and made available on demand at very low cost (see Chapter 11); • institutions will be making greater use of dynamic video (not talking heads) for demonstration, simulations, animations, etc. Thus most content modules will be multi-media; • third, open textbooks incorporating multi-media components and student activities will provide the content, organization and interpretation that are the rationale for most lectures; • lastly, and most significantly, the priority for teaching will have changed from information transmission and organization to knowledge management, where students have the responsibility for finding, analyzing, evaluating, sharing and applying knowledge, under the direction of a skilled subject expert. Project-based learning, collaborative learning and situated or experiential learning will become much more widely prevalent.Also many instructors will prefer to use the time they would have spent on a series of lectures in providing more direct, individual and group learner support, thus bringing them into closer contact with learners. Thisdoesnotmeanthatlectureswilldisappearaltogether,buttheywillbespecialevents,andprobably multi-media, synchronously and asynchronously delivered. Special events might include: • a professor’s summary of her latest research, • the introduction to a course, • a point mid-way through a course for taking stock and dealing with common difficulties, or • the wrap-up to a course. Lectureswillprovideachanceforinstructorstomakethemselvesknown,toimparttheirinterestsand enthusiasm,andtomotivatelearners,butthiswillbejustone,relativelysmall,butimportantcomponent of a much broader learning experience for students. Foradifferentandinformedperspectiveontheroleandfutureoflectures,seeChristineGross-Loh, 2016. References Bates, A.

This interactionusuallytakestheformofsemi-structureddiscussion.Iwill nowexaminehowthiskindof learning has traditionally beenfacilitated by educators. 3.4.2Seminars and tutorials 3.4.2.1Definitions A seminar is a group meeting (either face-to-face or online) where a number of students participate at least as actively as the teacher, although the teacher may be responsible for the design of the group experience, such as choosing topics and assigning tasks to individual students. A tutorial is either a one-on-one session between a teacher and a student, or a very small group (three or four) of students and an instructor, where the learners are at least as active in discussion and presentation of ideas as the teacher. 3.4.2.2Seminars Seminarscanrangefromsixormorestudents,upto30studentsinthesamegroup.Becausethegeneral perceptionisthatseminarsworkbestwhennumbersarerelativelysmall,theytendtobefoundmoreat graduate level or the last year of undergraduate programs. Figure 3.4.1 Socrates and his students: Painter: Johann Friedrich Greuter, 1590: (San Francisco, Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts) Seminars and tutorials again have a very long history, going back at least to the time of Socrates and Aristotle.

There are a number of different approaches or terms within the broad heading of experiential learning, such as cooperative learning, adventurelearning andapprenticeship. Iwillusetheterm‘experientiallearning‘asabroadumbrella termtocoverthiswidevarietyofapproachestolearningbydoing.Iwilldealwithapprenticeshipasa separatesection(Chapter3.6)becauseofitstraditional(iftacit)roleinpreparinguniversityandcollege instructors, although it can be seen as just one of several methods of experiential learning. 3.5.1. What is experiential learning? Simon Fraser University (2010) has defined experiential learning as: the strategic, active engagement of students in opportunities to learn through doing, and reflection on those activities, which empowers them to apply their theoretical knowledge to practical endeavours in a multitude of settings inside and outside of the classroom. 125 Therearemanydifferenttheoristsinthisarea,suchasJohnDewey(1938)andmorerecentlyDavid Kolb (1984).There is a wide range of design models that aim to embed learning within real world contexts, including: • laboratory, workshop or studio work; • apprenticeship; • problem-based learning; • case-based learning; • project-based learning; • inquiry-based learning; • cooperative (work- or community-based) learning. The focus here is on some of the mainways in which experiential learning can be designed and delivered,withparticularrespecttotheuseoftechnology,andinwaysthathelpdeveloptheknowledge and skills needed in a digital age. (For a more detailed analysisof experiential learning, see Moon, 2004). 3.5.2Core design principles Experientiallearningfocusesonlearnersreflectingontheirexperienceofdoingsomething,soastogain conceptualinsightaswellaspracticalexpertise.Kolb’sexperientiallearningmodelsuggestfourstages in this process: • active experimentation; • concrete experience; • reflective observation; • abstract conceptualization. Experiential learning is a major form of teaching atthe University of Waterloo. Its web site lists the conditionsneeded toensurethatexperientiallearningiseffective, asidentifiedbytheAssociationfor Experiential Education. The next section examines different ways in which these principles have been applied. 3.5.3Experiential design models Therearemanydifferentdesignmodelsforexperientiallearning,buttheyalsohavemanyfeaturesin common. 3.5.3.1Laboratory, workshop or studio work Figure 3.5.2 Concordia University wood shop Today, we take almost for granted that laboratory classes are an essential part of teaching science andengineering.Workshopsandstudiosareconsideredcriticalformanyformsoftradestrainingorthe development of creative arts. Labs, workshops and studiosserve a number of important functions or goals, which include: • to give students hands-on experience in choosing and using commonscientific, engineering or trades equipmentappropriately; • to develop motor skills in using scientific, engineering or industrial tools or creative media; • to give students an understanding of the advantages and limitations of laboratory experiments; • to enable students to see science, engineering or trade work ‘in action’; • to enable students totest hypotheses or to see how well concepts, theories, procedures actually workwhen tested underlaboratory conditions; • to teachstudents how to design and/or conduct experiments; • to enable students to design andcreateobjects or equipment in different physical media. An important pedagogicalvalue of laboratory classes is that they enable students to move from the concrete(observingphenomena)totheabstract(understandingtheprinciplesortheoriesthatarederived from the observation of phenomena). Another is that the laboratoryintroduces students to a critical culturalaspectofscienceandengineering,thatallideasneedtobetestedin arigorousandparticular manner for them to be considered ‘true’. Onemajorcriticismoftraditionaleducationallabsorworkshopsisthattheyarelimitedinthekinds of equipment and experiences that scientists, engineers and trades people need today. As scientific, engineeringandtradesequipmentbecomesmoresophisticatedandexpensive,itbecomesincreasingly difficult to provide students in schools especially but increasingly now in colleges and universities direct access to such equipment. Furthermore traditional teaching labs orworkshops are capital and labourintensiveandhencedonotscaleeasily,acriticaldisadvantageinrapidlyexpandingeducational opportunities. Becauselaboratoryworkissuchanacceptedpartofscienceteaching,itisworthrememberingthat teachingsciencethroughlaboratoryworkisinhistoricaltermsafairlyrecentdevelopment.Inthe1860s neither Oxford nor Cambridge University were willing to teach empirical science. Thomas Huxley therefore developed a program at the Royal School of Mines (a constituent college of what is now ImperialCollege,oftheUniversityofLondon)toteachschool-teachershowtoteachscience,including howtodesignlaboratoriesforteachingexperimentalsciencetoschoolchildren,amethodthatisstillthe most commonly used today, both in schools and universities. Atthesametime,scientificandengineeringprogresssincethenineteenthcenturyhasresultedinother formsofscientifictestingandvalidationthattakeplaceoutsideatleastthekindof‘wetlabs’socommon inschoolsanduniversities.Examplesarenuclearaccelerators,nanotechnology,quantummechanicsand spaceexploration.Oftentheonlywaytoobserveorrecordphenomenainsuchcontextsisremotelyor digitally.Itisalsoimportanttobeclearabouttheobjectivesoflab,workshopandstudiowork.There maynowbeother,morepractical,moreeconomic,ormorepowerfulwaysofachievingtheseobjectives throughtheuseofnewtechnology,suchasremotelabs,simulations,andexperientiallearning.These will be examined in more detail later in this book. 3.5.3.2Problem-based learning The earliest form of systematised problem-based learning (PBL) was developed in 1969by Howard BarrowsandcolleaguesintheSchoolofMedicineatMcMasterUniversityinCanada,fromwhereithas spreadtomanyotheruniversities,collegesandschools.Thisapproachisincreasinglyusedinsubject domains where the knowledge base is rapidly expanding and where it is impossible for students to masteralltheknowledgeinthedomainwithin alimitedperiodofstudy.Workingingroups,students identifywhattheyalreadyknow,whattheyneedtoknow,andhowandwheretoaccessnewinformation thatmaylead toresolutionoftheproblem.Theroleoftheinstructor(usuallycalled atutorinclassic PBL) is critical in facilitating and guiding the learning process. Usually PBL follows a strongly systematised approach to solving problems, although the detailed stepsandsequencetend tovarytosomeextent,depending onthesubjectdomain.Thefollowingis a typical example: Figure 3.5.3 (derived from Gijeselaers, 1995) Traditionally,thefirstfivestepswouldbedoneinasmallface-to-faceclasstutorialof20-25students, withthesixthsteprequiringeitherindividualorsmallgroup(fourorfivestudents)privatestudy,witha theseventhstepbeingaccomplishedinafullgroupmeetingwiththetutor.However,thisapproachalso lendsitselftoblendedlearninginparticular,wheretheresearchsolution(step6)isdonemainlyonline, althoughsomeinstructorshavemanagedthewholeprocessonline,usingacombinationofsynchronous web conferencing and asynchronous online discussion. Developing a complete problem-based learning curriculum is challenging, as problems must be carefullychosen,increasingincomplexityanddifficultyoverthecourseofstudy, andproblems must be chosen so as to cover all the required components of the curriculum. Students often find the problem-basedlearningapproachchallenging,particularlyintheearlystages,wheretheirfoundational knowledgebasemaynotbesufficienttosolvesomeoftheproblems.(Theterm‘cognitiveoverload’has beenusedtodescribethissituation.)Othersarguethatlecturesprovideaquickerandmorecondensed waytocoverthesametopics.Assessmentalsohastobecarefullydesigned,especiallyifafinalexam carriesheavyweightingrading, toensurethatproblem-solvingskills aswellascontentcoverageare measured. However, research (see for instance, Strobel and van Barneveld, 2009) has found that problem.basedlearningisbetterforlong-termretentionofmaterialanddeveloping‘replicable’skills,aswellas forimprovingstudents’attitudestowardslearning.There arenowmanyvariations onthe‘pure’PBL approach,withproblemsbeingsetafterinitialcontenthasbeencoveredinmoretraditionalways,such as lectures or prior reading, for instance. The methodology of problem-based learning however is one essential tool for developing the knowledge and skills needed in a digital society. 3.5.3.3Case-based learning With case-based teaching, students develop skills in analytical thinking and reflective judgment by reading and discussing complex, real-life scenarios. University of Michigan Centre for Research on Teaching and Learning Case-basedlearningissometimesconsideredavariationofPBL,whileothersseeitasadesignmodelin itsownright.AswithPBL,case-basedlearningusesaguidedinquirymethod,butusuallyrequiresthe studentstohaveadegreeofpriorknowledgethatcanassistinanalysingthecase.Thereisusuallymore flexibilityintheapproachtocase-basedlearningcomparedtoPBL.Case-basedlearningisparticularly popularinbusinesseducation,lawschoolsandclinicalpracticeinmedicine,but canbeusedinmany other subject domains. Herreid (2004) provides eleven basic rules for case-based learning. 1. Tells a story. 2. Focuses on an interest-arousing issue. 3. Set in the past five years 4. Creates empathy with the central characters. 5. Includes direct quotations from the characters. 6. Relevant to the reader. 7. Must have pedagogic utility. 8. Conflict provoking. 9. Decision forcing. 10. Has generality. 11. Is short. Usingexamples fromclinicalpractice inmedicine, Irby(1994)recommends fivestepsincase-based learning: • anchor teaching in a (carefully chosen) case; • actively involve learners in discussing, analysing and making recommendations regarding the case; • model professional thinking and actionas an instructor when discussing the case with learners; • provide direction and feedback to learners in their discussions; • create a collaborative learning environment where all views are respected. Case-basedlearning canbeparticularlyvaluablefordealingwithcomplex,interdisciplinarytopics or issueswhichhavenoobvious‘rightorwrong’solutions,orwherelearnersneedtoevaluateanddecide on competing, alternative explanations. Case-based learning can also work well in both blended and fullyonlineenvironments.Marcus,TaylorandEllis(2004)usedthefollowingdesignmodelforacase.based blended learning project in veterinary science: Figure 3.5.4 Blended learning sequence involving online learning resources, Marcus, Taylor and Ellis, 2004 Other configurations are of course also possible, depending on the requirements of the subject. 3.5.3.4Project-based learning Project-basedlearningissimilartocase-basedlearning,buttendstobelongerandbroaderinscope,and withevenmorestudent autonomy/responsibility inthe senseofchoosing sub-topics, organisingtheir work,anddecidingonwhatmethodstousetoconducttheproject.Projectsareusuallybasedaroundreal world problems, which give students a sense of responsibility and ownership intheir learning activities. Onceagain,there areseveralbestpractices orguidelinesforsuccessfulprojectwork.Forinstance, Larmer and Mergendoller (2010) argue that every good project should meet two criteria: • students must perceive the work as personally meaningful, as a task that matters and that they want to do well; • a meaningful project fulfills an educational purpose. Themaindangerwithproject-basedlearningisthattheprojectcantakeonalifeofitsown,withnotonly studentsbuttheinstructorlosingfocus onthekey, essentiallearningobjectives, orimportantcontent areas may not get covered. Thus project-based learning needs careful design and monitoring by the instructor. 3.5.3.5Inquiry-based learning Inquiry-basedlearning(IBL)issimilartoproject-basedlearning,buttheroleoftheteacher/instructoris somewhat different.In project-based learning, the instructor decides the ‘driving question’ and plays a more active role in guiding the students through the process.In inquiry-based learning, the learner exploresathemeandchoosesatopicforresearch,developsaplanofresearchandcomestoconclusions, although an instructor is usually available to provide help and guidance when needed. BanchiandBell(2008)suggestthattherearedifferentlevelsofinquiry,andstudentsneedtobeginat the first level and work through the other levels to get to ‘true’ or ‘open’ inquiry as follows: Figure 3.5.5 Levels of inquiry-based learning, from Banchi and Bell (2008) It can be seen that the fourth level of inquiry describes the graduate thesis process, although proponents of inquiry-based learning have advocated its valueat all levels of education. 3.5.4Experiential learning in online learning environments Someadvocatesofexperientiallearningarehighlycriticalofonlinelearning,because,theyargue,itis impossibletoembedlearninginrealworldexamples.However,thisisanoversimplification,andthere are contexts in whichonline learning can be usedveryeffectively to supportor develop experiential learning, in all its variations: • blended or flipped learning: although group sessions often start off the process, and/or bring a problem or project to a conclusion, they are usually done in a classroom or lab setting. However students can increasinglyconduct the research and information gathering by accessing resources online, by using online multimedia resources to create reports or presentations, and by collaborating online through group project work or through critique and evaluation of each other’s work; • fully online: increasingly, instructors are finding thatexperiential learning can be applied fully online, through a combination of synchronous tools such as web conferencing, asynchronous tools such as discussion forums and/or social media for group work, e-portfolios and multimedia for reporting, and remote labs for experimental work. Indeed,therearecircumstanceswhereitisimpractical,toodangerous,ortooexpensivetouserealworld experientiallearning.Onlinelearningcanbeusedtosimulaterealconditionsandtoreducethetimeto masteraskill.Flightsimulatorshavelongbeenusedtotraincommercialpilots,enablingtraineepilotsto spendlesstimemasteringfundamentalsonrealaircraft.Commercialflightsimulatorsarestillextremely expensivetobuildandoperate,butinrecentyearsthecostsofcreatingrealisticsimulationshasdropped dramatically. Figure 3.5.6 Virtual world border crossing, Loyalist College, Ontario InstructorsatLoyalistCollegehavecreateda‘virtual’fullyfunctioningbordercrossingandavirtual carinSecondLifetotrainCanadianBorderServicesAgents.Eachstudenttakesontheroleofanagent, with his/her avatar interviewing the avatars of thetravellers wishing to enter Canada.

The whole process is recorded and followed later by a face-to-face debriefing session. Onceagain,designmodelsarenotinmostcasesdependentonanyparticularmedium.Thepedagogy transfers easily across different delivery methods. Learning by doing is an important method for developing many of the skills needed in a digital age. 3.5.5Strengths and weaknesses of experiential learning models How one evaluates experiential learning designsdepends partly on one’s epistemological position. Constructivists strongly support experiential learning models,whereasthosewith astrongobjectivist positionareusuallyhighlyskepticaloftheeffectivenessofthisapproach.Nevertheless,problem-based learninginparticularhasprovedtobeverypopularinmanyinstitutionsteachingscienceormedicine, and project-based learning is used acrossmany subject domains and levels of education. There is evidencethatexperientiallearning,whenproperlydesigned,ishighlyengagingforstudentsandleads tobetterlong-termmemory.Proponentsalsoclaimthatitleadstodeeperunderstanding,anddevelops skillsforadigitalagesuchasproblem-solving,criticalthinking,improvedcommunicationsskills,and knowledgemanagement.Inparticular, it enables learners tomanagebetterhighly complexsituations thatcrossdisciplinaryboundaries,andsubjectdomainswheretheboundariesofknowledgearedifficult to manage. Critics though such as Kirschner, Sweller and Clark (2006) argue thatinstruction in experiential learning is often ‘unguided’, and pointed to several ‘meta-analyses’ of the effectiveness of problem.basedlearningthatindicatednodifferenceinproblem-solvingabilities,lowerbasicscienceexamscores, longer study hours for PBL students, and that PBL is more costly.They conclude: In so far as there is any evidence from controlled studies, it almost uniformly supports direct, strong instructional guidance rather than constructivist-based minimal guidance during the instruction of novice to intermediate learners. Even with students with considerable prior knowledge, strong guidance when learning is most often found to be equally effective as unguided approaches. Certainly,experientiallearningapproachesrequireconsiderablere-structuringofteachingandagreat dealofdetailedplanningifthecurriculumistobefullycovered.Itusuallymeansextensivere-training offaculty,andcarefulorientationandpreparationofstudents.IwouldalsoagreewithKirschneretal. thatjustgivingstudentstaskstodoinrealworldsituationswithoutguidanceandsupportislikelytobe ineffective. However, many forms of experiential learning can and do have strong guidance from instructors, and one has to be very careful when comparing matched groups that the tests of knowledge include measurement of the skills that are claimed to be developed by experiential learning, and are not just based on the same assessments as for traditional methods, which often have a heavy bias towards memorisation and comprehension. Onbalancethen,Iwouldsupporttheuseofexperientiallearningfordevelopingtheknowledgeand skillsneededinadigitalage,butasalways,itneedstobedonewell,followingbestpracticesassociated with thedifferentdesign models. References Banchi, H., andBell, R.

It has key elements: a particular way of viewing learning, specific roles and strategies for teachers and learners, and clear stages of development, whether for traditional or cognitive apprenticeship. But mostly it’s important to remember that in this perspective, one cannot learn from afar. Instead, one learns amid the engagement of participating in the authentic, dynamic and unique swirl of genuine practice.‘ Pratt and Johnson, 1998 Schön (1983) argues that apprenticeship operates in ‘situations of practice that…are frequently ill-defined and problematic, and characterized by vagueness, uncertainty and disorder‘. Learning in apprenticeshipis notjustaboutlearning todo(activelearning),butalsorequires anunderstandingof thecontexts inwhichthelearningwillbeapplied.Inadditionthereisasocialandculturalelement to thelearning,understandingandembeddingtheacceptedpractices,customsandvaluesofexpertsinthe field.PrattandJohnson(1998)identifythecharacteristicsofamasterpractitioner,whomtheydefineas: a person who has acquired a thorough knowledge of and/or is especially skilled in a particular area of practice. Master practitioners: 1. possess great amounts of knowledge in their area of expertise, and are able to apply that knowledge in difficult practice settings; 2. have well-organized, readily accessible schemas (cognitive maps) which facilitate the acquisition of new information; 3. have well-developed repertoires of strategies for acquiring new knowledge, integrating and organizing their schemas, and applying their knowledge and skills in a variety of contexts….; 4. …are motivated to learn as part of the process of developing their identities in their communities of practice.

Atraditional apprenticeship experience, based on developing a motorormanual skill, involveslearningaprocedureandgraduallydevelopingmastery,duringwhichthemasterandlearnergo through several stages. 3.6.3 University apprenticeship Anintellectual or cognitive apprenticeshipmodelissomewhatdifferentbecausethisformoflearningis lesseasilyobservablethanlearningmotorormanualskills.PrattandJohnsonarguethatinthiscontext, masterandlearner must saywhatthey are thinkingduringapplicationsofknowledge andskills,and mustmakeexplicitthecontextinwhichtheknowledgeisbeingdeveloped,becausecontextissocritical tothewayknowledgeisdevelopedandapplied.PrattandJohnsonsuggestfivestagesforcognitiveand intellectual modelling (p. 99): 1. modelling by the master and development of a mental model/schema by the learner; 2. learner approximates replication of the model with master providing support and feedback (scaffolding/coaching); 3. learner widens the range of application of the model, with less support from master; 4. self-directed learning within the specified limits acceptable to the profession; 5. generalizing: learner and master discuss how well the model might work or would have to be adapted in a range of other possible contexts. Pratt and Johnson provide a concrete example of how this apprenticeship model might work for a noviceuniversityprofessor(pp.100-101).Theyarguethatforcognitiveapprenticeshipitisimportantto createa forum or set of opportunities for: articulate discussion and authentic participation in the realities of practice from within the practice, not from just one single point of view.

As a result, there are large numbers of experienced tradespeople in the workforce without full accreditation, limiting their career development and slowing down economic development where there are shortages of fully qualified skilled workers; • in trades or occupations undergoing rapid change in the workplace, the apprenticeship model can slow adaptation or change in working methods, because of the prevalence of traditional values and norms being passed down by the ‘master’ that may no longer be as relevant in the new conditions facing workers. This limitation of the apprenticeship model can be clearly seen in the post-secondary education sector, where traditional values and norms around teaching are increasingly in conflict with external forces such as new technology and the massification of higher education. Nevertheless, the apprenticeship model, whenappliedthoroughly and systematically, is a veryuseful model for teaching in highly complex, real-world contexts. References Bloom, B.S.

Learners’ efficacy and self-esteem issues become the ultimate criteria against which learning success is measured, rather than performance-related mastery of a content body. Thereisastrongemphasisontheteacherfocusingontheinterestsofthelearner,onempathizingwith howthelearnerapproacheslearning,oflisteningcarefully towhatthelearnerissayingandthinking whenlearning,andprovidingappropriate,supportiveresponsesintheformof‘consensual validation of experience‘.Thisperspectiveisdrivenpartlybytheobservationthatpeoplelearnautonomouslyfrom a very early age, so the trick is to create an environment for the learner that encourages rather than inhibits their ‘natural’ tendency to learn,and directs it into appropriate learning tasks, decided by an analysisofthelearner’sneeds.ThisisfurtherelaboratedinChapter6,onBuildinganEffectiveLearning Environment. 3.7.2 The social reformperspective Pratt (1998, p. 173) states: Teachers holding a social reform perspective are most interested in creating a better society and view their teaching as contributing to that end. Their perspective is unique in that it is based upon an explicitly stated ideal or set of principles linked to a vision of a better social order. Social reformers do not teach in one single way, nor do they hold distinctive views about knowledge in general…these factors all depend on the particular ideal that inspires their actions. Thistheninsomewaysislessatheoryofteachingasanepistemologicalposition,thatsocietyneeds change,andthesocialreformerknowshowtobringaboutthischangethroughteachingandeducation. Indeed,asFigure3.7.2belowillustrates,thesocialreformmodeloflearningcanbedrivenasmuchby the passions and concerns of learners as by those of their instructors. Figure 3.7.2 3.7.3Past and future: the relevance of the nurturing and social reform methods for connectivism These two perspectives onteaching again have a long history, with echoes of: • Jean-Jacques Rousseau(1762):‘education should be carried out, so far as possible, in harmony with the development of the child’s natural capacities by a process of apparently autonomous discovery‘ (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) • Malcolm Knowles (1984): ‘As a person matures his self concept moves from one of being a dependent personality toward one of being a self-directed human being.’ • Paulo Freire (2004):‘education makes sense because women and men learn that through learning they can make and remake themselves, because women and men are able to take responsibility for themselves as beings capable of knowing—of knowing that they know and knowing that they don’t.’ • Ivan Illich (1971) (in his criticism of the institutionalization of education):‘The current search for new educational funnelsmust be reversed into the search for their institutional inverse: educational webswhich heighten the opportunity for each one to transform each moment of his living into one of learning, sharing, and caring.’ Thereasonwhythenurturingandsocialreformperspectivesonteachingareimportantisbecausethey reflectmanyoftheassumptionsorbeliefsaroundconnectivism(Chapter2.6).Indeed,asearlyas1971, Illich made this remarkable statementfor the use of advanced technology to support “learning webs”: The operation of a peer-matching network would be simple. The user would identify himself by name and address and describe the activity for which he sought a peer. A computer would send him back the names and addresses of all those who had inserted the same description. It is amazing that such a simple utility has never been used on a broad scale for publicly valued activity. Well, those conditions certainly exist today. Learners do not necessarily need to go through institutionalgatewaystoaccessinformationorknowledge,whichisincreasingavailableandaccessible throughtheInternet.AsweshallseeinChapter5,MOOCshelptoidentifythosecommoninterestsand connectivistMOOCsinparticularaimtoprovidethenetworksofcommoninterestsandtheenvironment forself-directedlearning.Thedigitalageprovidesthetechnologyinfrastructureandsupportneededfor this kind of learning. 3.7.4The roles of learners and teachers Of all the perspectives onteaching these twoarethe most learner-centred. They arebased on a profoundlyoptimisticviewofhumannature,thatpeoplewillseekoutandlearnwhattheyneed,andwill findthenecessarysupportfromcaring,dedicatededucatorsand/orfromotherswithsimilarinterestsand concerns,andthatindividualshavethecapacityandabilitytoidentifyandfollowthroughwiththeirown educationalneeds.Itisalsoamoreradicalviewofeducation,becauseitseekstoescapethepoliticaland controlling aspects of state or privateinstitutions. Withineachofthesetwoperspectives,therearedifferencesofviewaboutthecentralityofteachers forsuccessfullearning.ForPratt,theteacherplaysacentralroleinnurturinglearning;forotherssuch asIllichorFreire,professionallytrainedteachersaremorelikelytobetheservantofthestatethanof theindividuallearner.Forthosesupportingtheseperspectivesonteaching,volunteermentorsorsocial groups organised around certain ideals or social goals provide the necessary support for learners. 3.7.5Strengths and weaknesses of these two approaches There are, as always, a number of drawbacks to these two perspectives onteaching: • The teacher in a nurturing approach needs to adopta highly dedicated and unselfish approach, putting the demands and needs of the learner first. This often means for teachers who areexperts in their subject holding back the transmission and sharing of their knowledge until the learner is ‘ready’, thus denying to many subject experts their own identity and needs to a large extent; • Pratt argues that ‘although content is apparently neglected, children taught by nurturing educators do continue to master it at much the same rate as children taught by curriculum-driven teaching methodologies‘, but no empirical evidence is offered to support this statement, although it does derive in Pratt’s case fromstrong personal experience of teaching in this way; • like all the other teaching approaches the nurturing perspectiveis driven by a very strong belief system, which will not necessarily be shared by other educators (or parents – or even learners, for that matter); • a nurturing perspective necessitatesprobably the mostlabour-intensive of all the teaching modelsother than apprenticeship, requiring a deep understanding on the part of the teacher of each learner and that learner’s needs; every individual learner is different and needs to be treated differently, and teachers need to spend a great deal of time identifying learners’ needs, theirreadiness to learn, and building or creating supportive environments or contexts for that learning; • there may wellbe a conflict between what the learner identifies as their personal learning needs, and the demands of society in a digital age. Dedicated teachers may be able to help a learner negotiate that divide, but in situationswhere learners are left without professional guidance, learners mayend up just talking to other individuals with similar views that do not progress their learning (remembering that academic teaching is a rhetorical exercise, challenging learners to view the world differently); • social reform depends to a large extent on learners and teachers embracing similar belief systems, and can easily descend into dogmatism without challenges from outside the ‘in-community’ established by self-referential groups. Nevertheless, there are aspects of both perspectivesthat have significance for a digital age: • both nurturing and social reform perspectivesseems to work well for many adults in particular, and the nurturing approach also works wellfor younger children; • nurturing isan approach that has been adopted as much in advanced corporate training in companies such as Google as in informal adult education (see for instance, Tan,2012); • we shall see inChapter 5that connectivist MOOCs strongly reflect both the nurturing approach and the ability to create webs of connections that enable the development of self-efficacy and attempts at social reform; • both perspectivesseem to be effectivewhen learners are already fairly well educated and already have good prior knowledge and conceptual development; • perspectivesthat focus on the needs of individuals rather than institutions or state bureaucraciescan liberate thinking and learning and thus make the difference between ‘good’ and ‘excellent’ in creative thinking, problem-solving, and application of knowledge in complex and variable contexts. References Freire, P.

Do you think that connectivism is a modern reflection of either of these models of teaching– or is connectivisma distinct and unique method of teaching in itself?

Also, as we shall see, having this kind of understandingwillalsofacilitatean appropriatechoiceoftechnologyfor aparticularlearningtask or context. 3.8.2 Relating teaching methods totheknowledge and skills needed in a digital age Themainpurposeofthischapterhasbeentoenableyouasateachertoidentifytheclassroomteaching methodsthat aremostlikelytosupportthedevelopmentoftheknowledgeandskillsthatstudents or learnerswillneedin adigitalage.We stillhave awaytogobefore wehavealltheinformationand toolsneeded tomakethisdecision,but wecanatleasthave astabatitfromhere,whilerecognising thatsuchdecisionswilldependonawidevarietyoffactors,suchasthenatureofthelearnersandtheir prior knowledge and experience, the demands of particular subject areas, the institutional context in which teachers and learners find themselves, and the likely employment context for learners. First, we can identify a number of different types of skills needed: • conceptual skills, such as knowledge management, critical thinking, analysis, synthesis, problem-solving, creativity/innovation, experimental design; • developmental or personal skills, such as independent learning, communications skills, ethics, networking, responsibility and teamwork; • digital skills, embedded within and related to a particular subject or professional domain; • manual and practical skills, such as machine or equipment operation, safety procedures, observation and recognition of data, patterns, and spatialfactors. Wecanalsoidentifythatintermsofcontent,weneedteachingmethodsthatenablestudentstomanage information or knowledge, rather than methods that merelytransmit information tostudents. There areseveral keypoints for a teacher or instructor to note: • the teacher needs to be able to identify/recognise the skills they are hoping to develop in their students; • these skills are often not easily separated but tend to be contextually based and often integrated; • teachers need to identify appropriate methods and contextsthat willenable students to develop these skills; • students will need practice to develop such skills; • students will need feedback and intervention from the teacher and other students to ensure a high level of competence or mastery in the skill; • an assessment strategy needs to be developed that recognises and rewards students’ competency and mastery of such skills. Ina digitalage,just choosing a particular teaching methodsuch asseminars or apprenticeship is not goingtobesufficient. Itisunlikelythat onemethod, such astransmissive lectures, orseminars,will providearichenoughlearningenvironmentforafullrangeofskillstobedevelopedwithinthesubject area. It is necessaryto provide a rich learning environment for students to develop such skills that includescontextualrelevance,andopportunitiesforpractice,discussionandfeedback.Asaresult,we are likely to combine different methods of teaching. Secondly, this chapter has focused mainly on classroom or campus-based approaches to teaching. In the next chapter a range of teaching methods that incorporateonline/digital technologies will be examined. So it would be foolish at this stage to say that any single method, such as seminars, or apprenticeship, or nurturing, is the best method for developing theknowledge and skills needed in a digitalage.Atthesametime,thelimitationsoftransmissivelectures,especiallyiftheyareusedasthe mainmethod for teaching, are becoming moreapparent. 1. Think of what you consider in the past to have been your most successful unit of teaching (a class or a whole course). Can you identify the underlying epistemology? What theory or theories of learning would best describe how students learned in that context? What was the main teaching method(s) you used? 2. Look at one of the courses you are likely to be teaching next year. How would you change your teaching methods on that course, now you have read Chapters 1, 2 and 3? There is no direct feedback from me on this activity as it is a reflective exercise. Thislistofclassroomorcampus-basedteachingmethodsisnotmeanttobeexhaustiveorcomprehensive.

In particular, methods that focus on conceptual development, such as dialogue and discussion, knowledge management (rather than information transmission), and experiential learning in real-world contexts, are all methods more likely to develop the high level conceptual skills required in a digital age. 3. It is not just conceptual skills though that are needed. It is the combination of conceptual, practical, personal and socialskills in highly complex situations that are needed. This again means combining a variety of teaching methods. 4. Nearly allof these teaching methods are media or technology independent. In other words, they can be used in classrooms or online. What matters from a learning perspective is not so much the choice of technologyas the efficacy and expertise in appropriately choosing and using the teaching method. 5. Nevertheless, we shall see in the next chapterthat new technologies offer new possibilities for teaching, including offering more practice or time on task, reaching out to new target groups, and increasing the productivity of both teachers and the system as a whole. Chapter 4: Methods of teaching with an online focus At the end of this chapter you should be able to: 1. Describe key approaches to the design of online teaching and learning. 2. Analyse each model in terms of its value for teaching in a digital age. 3. Decide which model or combination of models will fit best with your own teaching. 4. Use the model as a basis for designing your own teaching. What is covered in this chapter • Scenario D: Developing historical thinking • 4.1 Online learning and teaching methods • 4.2 Old wine in new bottles: classroom-type online learning • 4.3 The ADDIE model • 4.4 Online collaborative learning • 4.5 Competency-based learning • 4.6 Communities of practice • Scenario E: ETEC 522: Ventures in e-Learning • 4.7 ‘Agile’ Design: flexible designs for learning • 4.8 Making decisions aboutteaching methods Also in this chapter you will find the following activities: • Activity 4.1 There is no activity for this section • Activity 4.2 Moving the classroom model online • Activity 4.3 Using the ADDIE model • Activity 4.4 Evaluating online collaborative learning models • Activity 4.5 Thinking about competency-based education • Activity 4.6 Making communities of practice work • Activity 4.7 Taking risks with ‘agile’ design • Activity 4.8 Making choices 153 1. Traditional classroom teaching, and especially transmissive lectures, were designed for another age.

You can listen to it online here: https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/teachinginadigitalagev2/?p=114 Online learning is increasingly influencing both classroom/campus-based teaching but more importantly it is leading to new models or designs for teaching and learning. When commercial movies were first produced, they were basically a transfer ofprevious music hall and vaudeville acts to the movie screen. Then along came D.W. Griffith’s ‘Birth of a Nation’, whichtransformedthedesignofmovies,byintroducingtechniquesthat wereuniquetocinemaatthe time,suchaspanoramiclongshots,panningshots,realisticbattlescenes,andwhatarenowknownas special effects. A similar development has taken place with online learning. Initially, there were two separate influences: designs from classroom teaching; and designs inherited from print-based or multimedia distanceeducation.Overtime,though,newdesignsthatfullyexploittheuniquecharacteristicsofonline learning are beginning to emerge. What we do when we move teaching online is to change the learning environment. Thus, I am 157 beginningtomovefromtalkingaboutteachingmethods(whichcanbethesamebothinclassandonline) to design models, where the teaching method is deliberately adapted to the learning environment. 4.2Old wine in new bottles: classroom-type online learning Westartwithclassroomteachingmethodsthathavebeenmovedintoatechnologicalformatwithlittle change to the overall design principles. I will argue that these are essentiallyold designs in new bottles. 4.2.1 Live, streamed video Thisisbasicallyaclassroomlecturedeliveredatthetimeofdeliverytoremotestudents(althoughthere mayalsobelivestudentsinthelecturetheatreaswell).Theremotestudentsmaybewatchingontheir ownathome,work orintransit, or(moreoften)insmallgroups atanothercampus orlocallearning centre.Thereisnochangeinthedesign,althoughtheinstructormayneedtomakesurethattheremote students are not ignored if there are questions or discussion.For an example, seehere. Thisisoftenthefirststepinstructorstakeintoonlinelearning,becausetheydonothavetodoanything newotherthanlearnhowtosetupandswitchontheequipment.Asthetechnologybecamecheaperand 159 easiertouse,theuseoflivestreamedlecturesdoubledbetween2016and2017inCanada(Batesetal., 2018). Someinstructorsrequireallstudentstobepresentduringthelivelectureinordertoensurediscussion, but this can be counter-productive if the aim of going online is to increase flexibility for students. This can be countered by using an online asynchronous discussion forum in a learning management system(formoreonthis,seeChapter4.4).Inmostcases,though,lecturerspreferalsotorecordthelive transmission so all students can access the lecture at any time (see the next section below). 4.2.2 Classes using lecture capture Thistechnology,whichautomaticallyrecordsaclassroomlecture,wasoriginallydesignedtoenhance theclassroommodelbymakinglecturesavailableforrepeatviewingsonline atanytimeforstudents regularly attending classes – in other words, a form of homework or revision. Figure 4.2.2 An MIT classroom lecture recorded and made available through MIT’s OpenCourseWare.

These are important differences from a physical classroom, and skilled teachersandinstructorscanmodifyoradaptLMSstomeetdifferentteachingorlearningrequirements (astheycaninphysicalclassrooms),butthebasicorganizingframeworkoftheLMSremainsthesame as for a physical classroom. Nevertheless, the LMS is still an advance over online designs that merely put lectures on the Internetaspre-recordedvideos, orloaduppdfcopiesofPowerpointlecturenotes, asisstillthe case unfortunately in many online programs. There is also enough flexibility in the design of learning managementsystemsforthemtobeusedinwaysthatbreakawayfromthetraditionalclassroommodel, which is important, as good online design shouldtake account of the special requirementsof online learners, so the design needs to be different from that of a classroom model. 4.2.3The limitations of the classroom design model for online learning Oldwinecanstillbegoodwine,whetherthebottleisnewornot.Whatmattersiswhetherclassroom design meets the changing needs of a digital age.

I give here just a very brief introduction. 165 4.3.1What is ADDIE? ADDIE stands for: Analyse • identify all the variables that need to be considered when designing the course, such as learner characteristics, learners’ prior knowledge, resources available, etc. This stage is similar to the describing the learning environment outlined inAppendix 1of this book; Design • this stage focuses on identifying the learning objectives for the course and how materials will be created and designed (for instance, it may include describing what content areas are to be covered anda storyboard outliningwhat will be covered in text, audio and video and in what order),and deciding on the selection and use of technology, such as an LMS, video or social media; Develop • the creation of content, including whether to develop in-house or outsource, copyright clearance for third party materials, loading of content into a web site or LMS,and so on; Implement • this is the actual delivery of the course, including any prior training or briefing of learner support staff, and student assessment; Evaluate • feedback and data is collected in order to identify areas that require improvement and this feeds into the design, development and implementation of the next iteration of the course. 4.3.2Where is ADDIE used? Thisisadesignmodelusedbymanyprofessionalinstructionaldesignersfortechnology-basedteaching. ADDIE has been almost a standard for professionally developed, high quality distance education programs, whether print-based or online. It is also heavily used in corporate e-learning and training. Therearemanyvariationsonthismodel(myfavouriteis‘PADDIE’,whereplanningand/orpreparation areaddedatthestart).Themodelismainlyappliedonaniterativebasis,withevaluationleadingtore.analysisandfurtherdesignanddevelopmentmodifications.One reasonforthewidespread useofthe ADDIEmodelisthatitisextremelyvaluableforlargeandcomplexteachingdesigns.ADDIE’sroots gobacktotheSecondWorldWarandderivefromsystemdesign,whichwasdevelopedtomanagethe hugely complex Normandy landings. Manyopenuniversities,suchastheU.K.OpenUniversityandtheOUoftheNetherlands,Athabasca UniversityandThompsonRiversOpenUniversity inCanada,still makeheavyuse ofADDIEto managethedesignofcomplexmulti-mediadistanceeducationcourses.WhentheU.K.OUopenedin 1971withaninitialintakeof20,000,itusedradio,television,speciallydesignedprintedmodules,text books,reproducedresearcharticlesintheformofselectedreadingsthat weremailedtostudents,and regionalstudygroups,withteamsofoften20academics,mediaproducersandtechnologysupportstaff developingcourses,andwithdeliveryandlearnersupportprovidedby anarmyofregionaltutorsand senior counsellors. Creating and delivering its first courses within two years of receiving its charter would have been impossiblewithout a systematic instructional design model,andin 2014,with over 200,000 students, the OU was still using the ADDIE approach for many of its courses. AlthoughADDIEandinstructionaldesigningeneraloriginatedintheUSA,theU.K. OpenUniversity’ssuccessindevelopinghighqualitylearningmaterialsinfluencedmany moreinstitutionsthatwereofferingdistanceeducationonamuchsmallerscaletoadopt theADDIEmodel,ifin amoremodestway, typicallywith asingleinstructorworking with an instructional designer. As distance education courses became increasingly developed as online courses, the ADDIE model continued, and is now being used by instructional designers in many institutionsfor the re-design of large lecture classes, hybrid learning, andfor fully online courses. 4.4.3What are the benefits of ADDIE? One reason it has been so successful is that it is heavily associated with good quality design, with clear learning objectives, carefully structured content, controlled workloads for faculty and students, integratedmedia,relevantstudentactivities,andassessmentstronglytiedtodesiredlearningoutcomes. AlthoughthesegooddesignprinciplescanbeappliedwithorwithouttheADDIEmodel,ADDIEisa modelthatallowsthesedesignprinciplestobeidentifiedandimplementedonasystematicandthorough basis. It is also a very useful management tool, allowing for the design and development of large numbers of courses to a standard high quality. 4.4.5What are the limitations of ADDIE? The ADDIE approach can be used with any size of teaching project, but works best with large and complexprojects.Appliedtocourseswithsmallstudentnumbersandadeliberatelysimpleortraditional classroomdesign, it becomes expensive and possiblyredundant, although there isnothing tostopan individual teacher following this strategy when designing and delivering a course. A second criticism is that the ADDIE model is what might be called ‘front-end loaded’ in that it focusesheavilyoncontentdesignanddevelopment,butdoesnotpayasmuchattentiontotheinteraction betweeninstructorsandstudentsduring coursedelivery. Thusithasbeencriticisedbyconstructivists fornotpayingenoughattentiontolearner-instructorinteraction,andforprivileging morebehaviourist approaches to teaching. Another criticism is that while the five stages are reasonably well described in most descriptions ofthemodel,themodeldoes notprovideguidance onhowtomakedecisionswithinthatframework. Forinstance,itdoesnotprovideguidelinesorproceduresfordecidinghow tochoosebetweendifferent media, orwhat assessment strategies to use. Instructors have to go beyondthe ADDIE framework to make these decisions. Theover-enthusiasticapplicationoftheADDIEmodel canresultinoverlycomplexdesignstages, withmanydifferentcategoriesofworkers(faculty,instructionaldesigners,editors,webdesigners)and consequentlyastrongdivisionoflabour,resultingincoursestakinguptotwoyearsfrominitialapproval toactualdelivery.Themorecomplexthedesignandmanagementinfrastructure,themoreopportunities thereareforcostover-runsandveryexpensiveprogramming.Itisaverygoodexampleoftheindustrial approach to course design. Mymaincriticismthoughisthatthemodelistooinflexibleforthedigitalage.Howdoesateacher respondtorapidlydevelopingnewcontent,newtechnologiesorappsbeinglaunchedonadailybasis, toaconstantlychangingstudentbase?AlthoughtheADDIEmodelhasserveduswellinthepast,and providesagoodfoundationfordesigningteachingandlearning,itcanbetoopre-determined,linearand inflexibletohandlemorevolatilelearning contexts.Iwilldiscuss moreflexiblemodelsfordesignin Section 4.7. References Dick,W.,andCarey,L.(2004).The Systematic Design of Instruction Allyn&Bacon;6editionAllyn& Bacon Morrison, Gary R.

Collaborative group work. In this example the teacher has organized a class of 19 students into six groups. The teacher can interact with individual students or with each group as a whole. In online collaborative learning each group can have its own discussion area which can be ‘closed’ (except to the teacher) or open to the other students. In this model, all communication is textual, over the Internet, using online discussion forum software. However, the model could be applied to video-conferencing, but usually with smaller numbers of students due to bandwidth restrictions, or to classroom teaching. Each mode of delivery though will need its own variations in design for it to work well. Image: Tony Bates, 2019. 169 4.4.1 What is online collaborative learning? The concurrence of both constructivist approaches to learning and the development of the Internet hasled tothedevelopmentof aparticularformofconstructivistteaching,originallycalledcomputer.mediated communication (CMC), or networked learning, but which has been developed into what Harasim(2017)nowcallsonlinecollaborativelearningtheory(OCL).ShedescribesOCLasfollows(p. 90): OCL theory provides a model of learning in which students are encouraged and supported to work together to create knowledge: to invent, to explore ways to innovate, and, by so doing, to seek the conceptual knowledge needed to solve problems rather than recite what they think is the right answer. While OCL theory does encourage the learner to be active and engaged, this is not considered to be sufficient for learning or knowledge construction……In the OCL theory, the teacher plays a key role not as a fellow-learner, but as the link to the knowledge community, or state of the art in that discipline. Learning is defined as conceptual change and is key to building knowledge. Learning activity needs to be informed and guided by the norms of the discipline and a discourse process that emphasises conceptual learning and builds knowledge. OCLbuildsonandintegratestheoriesofcognitivedevelopmentthatfocusonconversationallearning (Pask,1975),conditionsfordeeplearning(MartonandSaljø,1997;Entwistle,2000),developmentof academic knowledge (Laurillard,2001), and knowledge construction (Scardamalia and Bereiter,2006). From the veryearly days of online learning, some instructors have focused heavily on the communicationaffordancesoftheInternet(seeforinstance,HiltzandTuroff,1978).Theyhavebased their teaching on the concept of knowledge construction, the gradual building of knowledge mainly through asynchronous online discussion among students and between students and an instructor. Online discussionforumsgoback tothe1970s,butreally tookoff asaresultofa combinationof theinventionoftheWorldWideWebinthe1990s,highspeedInternetaccess,andthedevelopmentof learningmanagementsystems,mostofwhichnowincludeanareaforonlinediscussions.Theseonline discussion forums have some differences though with classroom seminars: • first, they are text based, not oral; • second, they are asynchronous: participants can log in at any time, and from anywhere with an Internet connection; • third, many discussion forums allow for ‘threaded’ connections, enabling a response to be attached to the particular comment which prompted the response, rather than just displayed in chronological order. This allows for dynamic sub-topics to be developed, with sometimes more than ten responses within a single thread of discussion. This enables participants to follow multiple discussiontopicsover a period of time. 4.4.2Core design principles of OCL Harasim emphasises the importance of three key phases of knowledge construction through discourse: • idea generating: this is literally brainstorming, to collect the divergent thinking within a group; • idea organising: this is where learners compare, analyse and categorise the different ideas previously generated, again through discussion and argument; •intellectual convergence: the aim here is to reach a level of intellectual synthesis, understanding and consensus (including agreeing to disagree), usually through the joint construction of some artefact or piece of work, such as an essay or assignment. ThisresultsinwhatHarasimcallsaFinalPosition,althoughinrealitythepositionisneverfinalbecause foralearner, oncestarted,theprocessofgenerating, organisingand converging onideascontinues at aneverdeeperormoreadvancedlevel.Theroleoftheteacher orinstructorinthisprocessisseenas critical, not only infacilitating the process and providing appropriate resources and learner activities thatencouragethiskindoflearning,butalso,asarepresentativeofaknowledgecommunityorsubject domain,inensuringthatthecoreconcepts,practices,standardsandprinciplesofthesubjectdomainare fully integrated into the learning cycle. Harasim provides the following diagram to capture this process: Figure 4.4.2: Harasim’s pedagogy of group discussion (from Harasim, 2017, p. 95, with permission) Another important factor is that in the OCL model, discussion forums are not an addition or supplement tocore teaching materials, such as textbooks, recorded lectures, or text in an LMS, but are the core component of the teaching. Textbooks, readings and other resources are chosen to support the discussion, not the other way round. This is a key design principle, and explains why often instructors or tutors complain, in more ‘traditional’ online courses, that students don’t participate in discussions. Often this is because where online discussions are secondary to more didactic teaching, or are not deliberately designed and managed to lead to knowledge construction, students see the discussions as optional or extra work, because they have no direct impact on grades or assessment. It is also a reason why awarding grades for participation in discussionforumsmisses the point. It is not the extrinsicactivity that counts, but the intrinsic value of the discussion, that matters (see, for instance, Brindley, Walti and Blashke,2009). Thus although instructors using an OCL approach may use learning management systems for convenience, they are used differently from courses where traditional didactic teaching is moved online. 4.4.3Community of Inquiry TheCommunityofInquiryModel(CoI)issomewhatsimilartotheOCLmodel.AsdefinedbyGarrison, Anderson and Archer (2000): An educational community of inquiry is a group of individuals who collaboratively engage in purposeful critical discourse and reflection to construct personal meaning and confirm mutual understanding. Garrison, Anderson and Archer argue that there are three essential elements of a community of inquiry: • social presence: is“the ability of participants to identify with the community (e.g., course of study), communicate purposefully in a trusting environment, and develop inter-personal relationships by way of projecting their individual personalities.” • teaching presence: is “the design, facilitation, and direction of cognitive and social processes for the purpose of realizing personally meaningful and educationally worthwhile learning outcomes” • cognitive presence: is“the extent to which learners are able to construct and confirm meaning through sustained reflection and discourse“. Figure 4.4.3: Community of Inquiry Image: © Terry Anderson/Marguerite Koole, 2013 However, CoI is more of a theory than a model, since it does not indicate what activities or conditions are needed to create these three ‘presences’. The two models (OCL and CoI) are also morecomplementary rather than competing. 4.4.4Developing meaningful online discussion SincethepublicationoftheoriginalCoIpaperin2000,therehavebeenanumberofstudiesthathave identifiedtheimportanceofthese‘presences’withinespeciallyonlinelearning(click hereforawide selection).Althoughtherehasbeen awiderangeofresearchersandeducatorsengagedinthe areaof online collaborative learning and communities of inquiry, there is a high degree of convergence and agreementaboutsuccessfulstrategiesanddesignprinciples.Foracademicandconceptualdevelopment, discussionsneed to bewell organized bytheteacher, andthe teacherneeds to providethe necessary support to enable the development of ideas and the construction of new knowledge for the students. Partlyasaresultofthisresearch,andpartlyastheresultofexperiencedonlineinstructorswhohave notnecessarilybeeninfluencedbyeithertheOCLortheCommunityofInquiryliterature,severalother design principles have been associated with successful (online) discussion, such as: • appropriate technology (for example, software that allows for threaded discussions); • clear guidelines on student online behaviour, such as written codes of conduct for participating in discussions, and ensuring that they are enforced; • student orientation and preparation, including technology orientation and explaining the purpose of discussion; • clear goals for the discussions that are understood by the students, such as: ‘to explore gender and class issues in selected novels’ or ‘to compare and evaluate alternative methods of coding’; • choice of appropriate topics, that complement and expand issuesin the study materials, and are relevant to answering assessment questions; • setting an appropriate ‘tone’ or requirements for discussion (for example, respectful disagreement, evidence-based arguments); • defining clearly learner roles and expectations, such as ‘you should log in at least once a week to each discussion topic and make at least one substantive contribution to each topic each week’; • monitoring the participation of individual learners, and responding accordingly, byproviding the appropriate scaffolding or support, such ascomments that help students develop their thinking around the topics, referring them back to study materials if necessary, or explaining issues when students seem to be confused or misinformed; • regular, ongoing instructor ‘presence’, such asmonitoring the discussions to prevent them getting off topic or too personal, andproviding encouragement for those that are making real contributions to the discussion, heading off those that are trying to hog or dominate the discussions, and tracking those not participating, and helping them to participate; • ensuring strong articulation between discussion topics and assessment. Theseissues arediscussedin moredepthbySalmon(2000);BatesandPoole(2003);andPaloffand Pratt (2005;2007). 4.4.5Cultural and epistemological issues Studentscometotheeducationalexperiencewithdifferentexpectationsandbackgrounds.As aresult there areoften major cultural differences in students with regard to participating in discussion-based collaborativelearningthatintheendreflectdeepdifferenceswithregardto traditionsoflearningand teaching.Thusteachersneedto beawarethatthere arelikelytobestudentsinanyclasswhomaybe strugglingwithlanguage,cultural orepistemologicalissues,butinonlineclasses,wherestudents can come from anywhere, this is a particularly important issue. In many countries, there is a strong tradition of the authoritarian role of the teacher and the transmissionofinformationfromtheteacher tothestudent.In somecultures,itwouldbeconsidered disrespectfultochallengeorcriticizetheviewsofteachersorevenotherstudents.Inanauthoritarian, teacher-basedculture,theviewsofotherstudentsmaybeconsideredirrelevant orunimportant.Other cultures have a strong oral tradition, or one based on story-telling, rather than on direct instruction. Onlineenvironmentsthencan presentrealchallenges tostudentswhen aconstructivistapproach to thedesignofonlinelearningactivitiesisadopted.Thismaymeantakingspecificstepstohelpstudents whoareunfamiliarwith aconstructivistapproach tolearning,such asaskingastudenttosenddrafts to the instructor by e-mail for approval before posting a ‘class’ contribution.For a fuller discussion ofcross-culturalissuesinonlinelearning,seeJungandGunawardena(2014)andthejournalDistance Education, Vol. 22, No. 1 (2001), the whole edition of which is devoted to papers on this topic. 4.4.6Strengths and weaknesses of online collaborative learning This approach to the use of technology for teaching is very different from the more objectivist approaches found in computer-assisted learning, teaching machines, and artificial intelligence applicationstoeducation,whichprimarilyaimtousecomputingtoreplaceatleastsomeoftheactivities traditionallydonebyhumanteachers.Withonlinecollaborativelearning,theaimisnottoreplacethe teacher, buttousethetechnologyprimarily toincreaseandimprovecommunicationbetweenteacher andlearners,withaparticularapproachtothedevelopmentoflearningbasedonknowledgeconstruction assistedanddevelopedthroughsocialdiscourse.Thissocialdiscoursefurthermoreisnot random,but managed in such a way as to ‘scaffold’ learning: • by assisting with the construction of knowledge in ways that are guided by the instructor; • that reflect the norms or values of the discipline; • thatalso respect or take into considerationtheprior knowledge within the discipline. Thus there are two main strengths of this model: • when applied appropriately, online collaborative learning can lead to deep, academic learning, or transformative learning, as well as, if not better than, discussion in campus-based classrooms. The asynchronous and recorded ‘affordances’ of online learning more than compensate for the lack of physical cues and other aspects of face-to-face discussion; • online collaborative learning as a result can also directly support the development of a range of high level intellectual skills, such as critical thinking, analytical thinking, synthesis, and evaluation, which are key requirements for learners in a digital age. There are though somelimitations: • it does not scale easily, requiring highly knowledgeable and skilled instructors, and a limited number of learners per instructor; • it is more likely to accommodate tothe epistemological positions of faculty and instructors in humanities, social sciences, education and some areas of business studiesandhealth and conversely it is likely to be less accommodating to the epistemological positions of faculty inscience, computer science and engineering. However, if combined with aproblem-based or inquiry-based approach, it might have acceptance even in some of the STEM subject domains. 4.4.7Summary Many of the strengths and challenges of collaborative learning apply both in face-to-face or online learningcontexts. Itcould be arguedthatthere is noor little difference betweenonline collaborative learningandwell-conductedtraditional classroom, discussion-based teaching. Although there are necessary adaptations depending on the mode of delivery, many of the core principles of successful collaborative learning (see Barkley, Major and Cross, 2014) will apply in both online and face-to.faceteaching.

WGU currently employs approximately 750 faculty whoactasmentors.Therearetwokindsofmentors:‘student’mentorsand‘course’mentors.Student mentors,whohavequalificationswithinthesubjectdomain,usuallyatamasterslevel,areinatleastbi.weeklytelephonecontactwiththeirstudents,dependingontheneedsofthestudentinworkingthrough their courses, and are the main contact for students. A student mentor is responsible for roughly 85 students.Students startwith amentorfromtheirfirstdayandstaywiththeirmentor untilgraduation. Studentmentorsassiststudentsindeterminingandmaintaininganappropriatepaceofstudy,andstepin with help when students are struggling. Course mentors are more highly qualified, usually with a doctorate, and provide extra support for students when needed. Course mentors will be available to between 200-400 students at a time, depending on the subject requirement. Students may contact either student or course mentors at any time (unlimited access) and mentors are expected to deal with student calls within one business day.

Practice tends to be more complex. 187 4.6.2 What are communities of practice? 4.6.2.1Definition: Communities of practice are groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly. Wenger,2014 4.6.2.2 What are communities of practice? The basic premise behind communities of practice is simple: we all learn in everyday life from the communities in which we find ourselves. Communities of practice are everywhere. Nearly everyonebelongs to some community of practice, whether it is through ourworking colleagues or associates, our profession or trade, or our leisure interests, such as a book club. Wenger (2000) argues thata community of practice is different from a community of interest or a geographical community in that it involves a shared practice:ways of doing things that are shared to some significant extent among members. 4.6.2.3 Characteristics Wenger argues that there are three crucial characteristics of a community of practice: • domain: a common interest that connects and holds together the community; • community: a community is bound by the sharedactivities they pursue (for example, meetings, discussions) around their common domain; • practice: members of a community of practice are practitioners; what they do informs their participation in the community; and what they learn from the community affects what they do. 4.6.2.4 Innovation and change Wenger (2000) has argued that although individuals learn through participation in a community of practice,moreimportantisthegenerationofnewerordeeperlevelsofknowledgethroughthesumof thegroupactivity.Ifthecommunityofpracticeiscenteredaroundbusinessprocesses,forinstance,this can be of considerable benefit to an organization. Smith (2003) notes that: …communities of practice affect performance..[This] is important in part because of their potential to overcome the inherent problems of a slow-moving traditional hierarchy in a fast-moving virtual economy. Communities also appear to be an effective way for organizations to handle unstructured problems and to share knowledge outside of the traditional structural boundaries. In addition, the community concept is acknowledged to be a means of developing and maintaining long-term organizational memory. BrownandDuguid(2000)describe acommunityofpracticedevelopedaroundtheXeroxcustomer servicerepresentativeswhorepairedthemachinesinthefield.TheXeroxrepsbeganexchangingtips and tricks over informal meetings atbreakfast or lunch and eventually Xerox saw the value of these interactions and created the Eureka project to allow these interactions to be shared across the global networkofrepresentatives.TheEurekadatabasehasbeenestimatedtohavesavedthecorporation$100 million.Companies such as Google and Appleare encouraging communities of practice through the sharing of knowledge across their many specialist staff. 2.6.2.5 Technologies Technology provides a wide range of tools that can support communities of practice, as indicated byWenger (2014) in the diagram below: Figure 4.6.2 Tools that support communities of practice Image: Wenger, 2014 4.6.3 Designing effective communities of practice Mostcommunitiesofpracticehavenoformaldesignandtendtobeself-organisingsystems.Theyhave anaturallifecycle,andcometoanendwhentheynolongerservetheneedsofthecommunity.However, thereisnowabodyoftheoryandresearchthathasidentifiedactionsthatcanhelpsustainandimprove the effectiveness of communities of practice. Wenger, McDermott and Snyder (2002) have identified seven key design principles for creating effective and self-sustaining communities of practice, related specifically to the management of the community, althoughthe ultimate success of a community of practicewill be determined by the activities of themembers of the community themselves. Designers of a community of practice need to: 4.6.3.1Design for evolution Ensurethatthecommunitycanevolveandshiftinfocustomeettheinterestsoftheparticipantswithout moving too far from the common domain of interest. 4.6.3.2 Open a dialogue between inside and outside perspectives Encouragetheintroductionanddiscussionofnewperspectivesthatcomeorarebroughtinfromoutside the community of practice. 4.6.3.3 Encourage and acceptdifferent levels of participation Different levels of participation include: • the ‘core’ (most active members), • those who participate regularly but do not take a leading role in active contributions, • hose (likely the majority) who are on the periphery of the community but may become more active participants if the activities or discussions start toengage them more fully. 4.6.3.4 Develop both public and private community spaces Communitiesofpracticearestrengthenediftheyencourageindividualorgroupactivitiesthataremore personalorprivateaswellasthemorepublicgeneraldiscussions;forinstance,individualsmaydecide toblogabouttheiractivities,orasmallgroupinanonlinecommunitythatliveorworkclosetogether may also decide to meet informally on a face-to-face basis. 4.6.3.5 Focus on value Attemptsshouldbemadeexplicitlytoidentify,throughfeedbackanddiscussion,thecontributionsthat the community most values. 4.6.3.6 Combine familiarity and excitement Focus both on shared, common concerns and perspectives, but also on the introduction of radical or challenging perspectives for discussionor action. 4.6.3.7 Create a rhythm for the community Thereneeds tobearegularscheduleofactivities orfocalpointsthatbringparticipantstogether ona regular basis,within the constraints of participants’ time and interests. 4.6.4Critical factors for success Subsequent research has identified a number of critical factors that influence the effectiveness ofparticipants incommunities of practice, These include being: • aware of social presence: individuals need to feel comfortable in engaging socially with other professionals or ‘experts’ in the domain, and those with greater knowledge must be willing to share in a collegial manner that respects the views and knowledge of other participants (social presence is defined as the awareness of others in an interaction combined with an appreciation of the interpersonal aspects of that interaction.) • motivated to share information for the common good of the community • able and willing to collaborate. EDUCAUSE has developedastep-by-step guidefor designing andcultivating communities of practice in higher education (Cambridge, Kaplan and Suter,2005). Lastly, research on other related sectors, such as collaborative learning or MOOCs, can inform the design and development of communities of practice. For instance, communities of practice need to balance between structure and chaos: too much structure and many participants are likely to feel constrainedinwhattheyneedtodiscuss;toolittlestructureandparticipantscanquicklyloseinterestor become overwhelmed. Many of the other findings about group and online behaviour, such as the need to respect others, observingonlineetiquette,andpreventingcertainindividualsfromdominatingthediscussion, areall likely to apply. However, because many communities of practice are by definition self-regulating, establishing rules of conduct and even more so enforcing themis really a responsibility ofthe participants themselves. 4.6.5 Learning through communities of practice in a digital age Communities of practiceare a powerful manifestation of informal learning. Theygenerallyevolve naturallytoaddresscommonlysharedinterestsandproblems.Bytheirnature,theytendtoexistoutside formaleducational organisations.Participants arenotusuallylookingforformalqualifications,but to addressissuesintheirlifeandtobebetteratwhattheydo.Furthermore,communitiesofpracticearenot dependentonanyparticularmedium;participantsmaymeetface-to-facesociallyoratwork,ortheycan participate in online or virtual communities of practice. It should benotedthat communities of practice can be very effective in a digitalworld, where the working context is volatile, complex, uncertain and ambiguous. A large part of the lifelong learning market will become occupied by communities of practice and self-learning, through collaborative learning,sharingofknowledgeandexperience,andcrowd-sourcingnewideasanddevelopment.Such informal learning provision will be particularly valuable for non-governmental or charitable organizations,suchastheRedCross,GreenpeaceorUNICEF,orlocalgovernment,lookingforwaysto engage communities in their areas of operation. Thesecommunitiesoflearnerswillbeopenandfree,andhencewillprovideacompetitivealternative to the high priced lifelong learning programs being offered by research universities. This will put pressureonuniversitiesandcollegestoprovidemoreflexiblearrangementsforrecognitionofinformal learning, in order to hold on to their current monopoly of post-secondary accreditation. Oneofthesignificantdevelopmentsinrecentyearshasbeentheuseofmassiveopenonlinecourses (MOOCs)fordeveloping online communities of practice. MOOCs are discussed in more detail in Chapter5,butitisworthdiscussingheretheconnectionbetweenMOOCsandcommunitiesofpractice. ThemoreinstructionistxMOOCsarenotreallydevelopedascommunitiesofpractice,becausetheyuse mainly a transmissive pedagogy, from experts to those considered less expert. Incomparison,connectivistMOOCsareanidealwaytobringtogetherspecialistsscatteredaroundthe worldtofocusonacommoninterestordomain.ConnectivistMOOCsaremuchclosertobeingvirtual communitiesofpractice,inthattheyputmuchmoreemphasisonsharingknowledgebetweenmoreor lessequalparticipants.However,currentconnectivistMOOCsdonotalwaysincorporatewhatresearch indicates are best practices for developing communities of practice, and those wanting to establish a virtualcommunityofpracticeatthemomentneedsomekindofMOOCprovidertogetthemstartedand give them access to the necessary MOOC software. Althoughcommunitiesofpractice arelikelytobecomemoreratherthanlessimportantin adigital age,itisprobablyamistaketothinkofthemasareplacementfortraditionalformsofeducation.Thereis nosingle,‘right’approachtothedesignofteaching.Differentgroupshavedifferentneeds.Communities ofpracticearemoreofanalternativeforcertainkindsoflearners,suchaslifelonglearners,andarelikely toworkbestwhenparticipantsalreadyhavesomedomainknowledgeandcancontributepersonallyand inaconstructivemanner–whichsuggeststheneedforatleastsomeformofpriorgeneraleducationor training for those participatingin effective communities of practice. In conclusion, itis clear is that in an increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous world,and giventhe openness of the Internet, the social media tools now available, and the need for sharing of knowledge on a global scale, virtual communities of practice will become even more common and important. Smart educators and trainerswill look to see how they can harness the strength of this design model, particularly for lifelong learning. However,merely lumping together large numbers of people with a common interest is unlikely to lead toeffective learning. Attention needs to be paid to those design principles that lead to effective communities of practice. References Brown,J.andDuguid,P.(2000)Balancing act: How to capture knowledge without killing it Harvard Business Review. Cambridge, D., Kaplan, S. and Suter, V.

The linear process of cause and effect becomes increasingly irrelevant, and it is necessary for knowledge workers to begin thinking in new ways and exploring new solutions. Inparticular, knowledgeworkersmust dealwithsituationsandcontexts thatarevolatile,uncertain, complexandambiguous(whatAdamsoncallsaVUCAenvironment).Thiscertainlyappliestoteachers workingwithevernew,emergingtechnologies,verydiversestudents,andarapidlychangingexternal world that puts pressure on institutions to change. If we look at course design, how does a teacher respond to rapidly developing new content, new technologiesorappsbeinglaunchedonadailybasis,toaconstantlychangingstudentbase,topressure todeveloptheknowledgeand skillsthat areneeded in adigital age?Forinstance, evensettingprior learningoutcomesisfraughtin aVUCAenvironment,unlessyou setthematanabstract‘skill’level suchasthinkingflexibly,networking,andinformationretrievalandanalysis.Studentsneedtodevelop thekeyknowledgemanagementskillsofknowingwhere tofindrelevantinformation,how toassess, evaluate andappropriately applysuch information.

First, there is no single approachtoagiledesign.Thewholepointistobeadaptabletothecircumstancesinwhichitoperates. Second,itisonlywiththedevelopmentoflight,easytousetechnologyandmediainthelastfewyears thatinstructorsand coursedesignershavestarted tobreakawayfromthestandarddesignmodels, so agile designs are still emerging. However, this is a challenge that software designers have also been facing(seeforinstance,LarmanandVodde,2009;Ries,2011)andperhapstherearelessonsthatcanbe applied to educational design. First, it is important to distinguish ‘agile’ designfrom rapid instructional design (Meier, 2000) or rapid prototyping, which are really both streamlined versions of the ADDIE model. Although rapid instructionaldesign/rapidprotypingenablecoursesormodulestobedesignedmorequickly(especially important forcorporate training), they still follow the same kind of sequential or iterative processes as in the ADDIE model, but in a more compressed form. Rapid instructional design and rapid prototypingmight be considered particular kindsof agiledesign, but they lack some of the most important characteristics outlined below: 4.7.2.1Light and nimble IfADDIEisa100-pieceorchestra,withacomplexscoreandlongrehearsals,thenagiledesignisajazz triowhogettogetherfor asingleperformancethenbreakupuntilthe nexttime.Althoughtheremay beashortpreparationtimebeforethe coursestarts,mostofthedecisionsaboutwhatwillgointothe course,whattoolswillbeused,whatactivitieslearnerswilldo,andsometimesevenhowstudentswill be assessed, are decided as the course progresses. On the teaching side, there are usually onlya fewpeople involved in the actual design, one or sometimes twoinstructors and possibly an instructionaldesigner, who neverthelessmeet frequently duringtheofferingofthecoursetomakedecisionsbasedonfeedbackfromlearnersandhowlearnersare progressing through the course. However, many more content contributors may be invited – or spontaneously offer – to participate on a single occasion as the course progresses. 4.7.2.2 Content, learner activities, tools used and assessmentvary,according to thechanging environment Thecontenttobecoveredinacourseislikelytobehighlyflexible,basedmoreonemergingknowledge and the interests or prior experience of the learners, although thecore skills that the course aims to develop are more likely to remain constant. For instance, for ETEC 522 in Scenario F, the overall objective is to develop the skills needed to be a pioneer or innovator in education, and this remains constantovereachiterationofthecourse.However,becausethetechnologyisrapidlydevelopingwith newproducts,appsandserviceseveryyear,thecontentofthecourseisquitedifferentfromyeartoyear. Also learner activities and methods of assessment are also likely to change, because students can use new tools or technology themselves for learning as they become available. Very often learners themselvesseek outandorganisemuchofthe corecontentofthe courseandarefreetochoosewhat tools they use. 4.7.2.3 The design attempts to exploit the affordances of either existing or emerging technologies Agiledesign aims to exploit fully the educational potential of new tools or software, which means sometimeschangingatleastsub-goals.Thismaymeandevelopingdifferentskillsinlearnersfromyear toyear,asthetechnologychangesandallowsnewthingstobedone.Theemphasishereisnotsomuch ondoingthesamethingbetterwithnewtechnology,butstrivingfornewanddifferentoutcomesthatare more relevant in a digital world. ETEC522forinstancedidnotstartwithalearningmanagementsystem.Instead,awebsite,builtin WordPress,wasusedasthestartingpointforstudentactivities,becausestudentsaswellasinstructors werepostingcontent,butinanotheryearthecontentfocusofthecoursewasmainlyonmobilelearning, so apps and other mobile tools were strong components of the course. 4.7.2.4 Sound, pedagogical principles guide the overall design of a course – to a point Just as most successful jazz trios work within a shared framework of melody, rhythm, and musicalcomposition, so is agiledesign shaped by overarching principles of best practice. Most successful agiledesigns have been guided by core design principles associated with ‘good’ teaching, such as clear learning outcomes or goals, assessment linked to these goals, strong learner support, includingtimelyandindividualisedfeedback,activelearning,collaborativelearning,andregularcourse maintenance based on learner feedback, all within a rich learning environment (see Appendix 1).Sometimesthoughdeliberateattemptsaremadetomoveawayfromanestablishedbestpracticefor experimentalreasons,butusuallyonasmallscale,to seeiftheexperimentworkswithoutriskingthe whole course. 4.7.2.5Experiential, open and applied learning Usually agilecourse design is strongly embedded in the real, external world. Much or all the course may be open to otherthan registered students. For instance, muchof ETEC 522, such as the final YouTubebusinesspitches,isopenlyavailable tothoseinterestedinthetopics.Sometimesthisresults in entrepreneurs contacting the course with suggestions for new tools or services, or just to share experience. AnotherexampleisacourseonLatinAmericanstudiesfromaCanadianuniversity.Thisparticular coursehadanopen,student-managedwiki,wheretheycoulddiscusscontemporaryeventsastheyarose.

It aims explicitly at helping students develop many of the specific skills they will need in a digital age, such as knowledge management, multimedia communication skills, critical thinking, innovation, and digital literacy embedded within a subject domain. Where agiledesign has been successfully used, students have found the design approach highlystimulatingandgreatfun,andinstructorshavebeeninvigoratedandenthusiasticaboutteaching. Agiledesignenables coursestobedevelopedandofferedquicklyand atmuchlowerinitial costthan ADDIE-based approaches. However, agile design approaches are very new and have not really been much written about, never mind evaluated. There is no ‘school’ or set of agreed principles to follow, although there are similaritiesbetweentheagileapproachtodesignforlearningwith‘agile’designforcomputersoftware. Indeeditcouldbearguedthatmostofthethingsinagiledesignarecoveredinotherteachingmodels, such as online collaborative learning or experiential learning. Despite this, innovative instructors are beginningtodevelopcoursesinasimilarwaytoETEC522andthereisaconsistencyinthebasicdesign principlesthatgivethemacertaincoherenceandshape, eventhougheach courseorprogramappears on the surface to be very different (another example of agiledesign, but campus-based, with quite a different overall programfrom ETEC 522,is theIntegrated Science programat McMaster University.) Certainlyagiledesignapproachesrequireconfidentinstructorswillingtotakearisk,and successis heavilydependent on instructorshaving a good background in best teaching practices and/or strong instructionaldesignsupportfrominnovativeandcreativeinstructionaldesigners.Becauseoftherelative lackofexperienceinsuchdesignapproachesthelimitations arenotwellidentifiedyet.Forinstance, thisapproachcanworkwellwithrelativelysmallclasssizesbuthowwellwillitscale?Successfuluse probablyalsodepends onlearnersalreadyhaving agoodfoundationalknowledgebaseinthesubject domain.NeverthelessIexpectmoreagiledesignsforlearningtogrowoverthecomingyears,because they are more likely to meet the needs of aVUCA world. References Adamson, C.

I set out below in Figure 4.8.2one way of doing this. I have chosen fivecriteria as headings along the top of the table: 4.8.1.1Epistemological basis What epistemologydoes this methodsuggest?Does the methodsuggesta view of knowledge as contentthat must be learned, does the method suggest a rigid (‘correct’) way ofdesigning learning (objectivist)?Ordoesthemethodsuggestthatlearningis adynamicprocessandknowledgeneeds to bediscoveredandisconstantlychanging(constructivist)?Doesthemethodsuggestthatknowledgelies in the connections and interpretations of different nodes or people on networksand that connections mattermoreintermsofcreatingandcommunicatingknowledgethantheindividualnodesorpeopleon thenetwork(connectivist)?Oristhemethodepistemologicallyneutral,inthatonecouldusethesame method to teach from different epistemological positions? 4.8.1.2Industrial (20th century) or digital (21st century) Does this methodlead to the kind of learning that wouldprepare people for an industrial society, withstandardisedlearningoutcomes,willithelpidentifyandselect arelativelysmalleliteforhigher education or senior positions in society, does it enable learning to be easily organised into similarly performing groups of learners? Alternatively, does the method encourage the development of the soft skillsand the effective management of knowledge needed in a digital world? Doesthe method enable and support theappropriate educational use of the affordances of new technologies? Does it provide the kind of educationalsupportthatlearnersneedtosucceedinavolatile,uncertain,complexandambiguousworld? Does it enable and encourage learners to become global citizens? 4.8.1.3Academic quality Does the methodlead to deep understanding and transformative learning?

Technology and delivery method are more about access and flexibility and hence learner characteristics than they are about learning. Learning is affected more by pedagogy and the design of instruction; • second, different teaching methodsare likely to lead to different kinds of learning outcomes. This is why there is so much emphasis in this book on being clear about what knowledge and skills are needed in a digital age. These are bound to vary somewhat across different subject domains, but only to a limited degree. Understanding of content is always going to be important, but the skills of independent learning, critical thinking, innovation and creativity are even more important. Which teaching methodis most likely to help develop these skillsin your students? • third, quality depends not only on the choice of an appropriate teaching method, but also on how thatapproach to teaching is implemented. Online collaborative learning can be done well, or it can be done badly. The same applies to other methods. Following core design principles is critical for the successful use of any particular teaching method. Also there is considerable research on what the conditions are for success in using some of the newer methods or design models. The findings from suchresearch need to be applied when implementing a particular method (this is discussed further throughout the book, but specifically in Chapter 12); • lastly studentsand teachers get better with practice. If you are moving to a new method of teaching or design model, give yourself (and your students) time to get comfortable with it. It will probably take two or three courses where the new method or design is applied before you begin to feel comfortable that it is producing the results you were hoping for. However, it is better to make some mistakes along the way than to continue to teach comfortably, but not produce the graduates that are needed in the future. Therearestilltwomajorteachingmethodstobediscussed,OpenPedagogyinChapter11,Section4, and MOOCs, which needs theirown chapter (next). For my personal comments on some of the issues raised in this chapter, please click on the podcast below. An audio element has been excluded from this version of the text.

I shall be arguing that MOOCsareasignificantdevelopment,buttheyhaveseverelimitationsfordevelopingtheknowledge and skills needed in a digital age. 5.2.2 Key characteristics All MOOCs have some common features, although we shall see that the term MOOC covers an increasingly wide range of designs. 5.2.2.1 Massive By 2019, Coursera claimed over 35 million sign-upswith its largest course claiming 240,000 participants. The huge numbers (in the hundred of thousands) enrolling in the earliest MOOCs are notalwaysreplicatedinlaterMOOCs,butthenumbers arestillsubstantial.Forinstance,in2013,the University ofBritish ColumbiaofferedseveralMOOCsthrough Coursera, with thenumbersinitially signing up ranging from 25,000 to 190,000 per course (Engle,2014). However, even more important than the actual numbers is that in principle MOOCs have infinite scalability. There is technically no limit to their finalsize, because the marginal cost of adding each extraparticipantisnilfortheinstitutionsofferingMOOCs.(Inpractice thisisnotquitetrue,ascentral technology,backupandbandwidthcostsincrease,andasweshallsee,therecanbesomeknock-oncosts foraninstitutionofferingMOOCsasnumbersincrease.However,thecostofeachadditionalparticipant issosmall,giventheverylargenumbers,thatitcanbemoreorlessignored).ThescalabilityofMOOCs isprobablythecharacteristicthathasattractedthemostattention,especiallyfromgovernments,butit shouldbenotedthatthisisalsoacharacteristicofbroadcasttelevisionandradio,soitisnotuniqueto MOOCs. 5.2.2.2Open At least for the initial MOOCs, access was free for participants, although an increasing number of MOOCsarechargingafeeforassessmentleadingtoabadgeorcertificateorotherfees.Forinstance,in 2019 Coursera was charging between US$29-$99 per course. There are no pre-requisites for participants other than access to a computer/mobile device and the Internet.However,broadbandaccessisessentialforMOOCsthatusevideostreaming,whichseverely limits their potential for widening access to higher education in the least developed countries. There is another significant way in which MOOCs through Coursera and some other MOOC platformsarenotfullyopen(seeChapter11formoreonwhatconstitutes‘open’ineducation).Coursera ownstherights tothematerials, sotheycannotberepurposed orreusedwithoutpermission,andthe materialmayberemovedfromtheCourserasitewhenthecourseends.Also,Courseradecideswhich institutionscanhostMOOCsonitsplatform–thisisnotanopenaccessforinstitutions.Ontheother hand,edXisanopensourceplatform,soanyinstitutionthatjoinsedXcandeveloptheirownMOOCs withtheirownrulesregardingrightstothematerial.cMOOCsaregenerallycompletelyopen,butsince individualparticipantsofcMOOCscreatealotifnotallofthematerialitisnotalwaysclearwhether they own the rights and how long the MOOC materials will remain available. Indeed,there aremanyotherkindsofonlinematerialthat arealsoopenandfree overtheInternet, suchasopentextbooksandopeneducationalresources,ofteninwaysthataremoreaccessibleforreuse than MOOC material(seeChapter 11). 5.2.2.3Online MOOCs are offered at least initially wholly online, but increasingly institutions are negotiating with the rights holders to use MOOC materials in a blended format for use on campus. In other words, the institution provides learner support for the MOOC materials through the use of campus-based instructors.ForinstanceatSanJoseStateUniversity,on-campusstudentsusedMOOCmaterialsfrom Udacity courses, including lectures, readings and quizzes,and then instructorsspentclassroom time onsmall-groupactivities,projectsandquizzestocheckprogress(Collins,2013).Morevariationsinthe design of MOOCs will be discussed in more detail inSection 5.3. AgainthoughitshouldbenotedthatMOOCsarenotuniqueinofferingcoursesonline.In2017,there were6.3million studentsintheUSAalonetakingonline courses for credit,aspartofregulardegree programs (Seaman et. al, 2018). 5.2.2.4Courses OnecharacteristicthatdistinguishesMOOCsfrommostotheropeneducationalresourcesisthattheyare organizedintoawholecourse.However,whatthisactuallymeansforparticipantsisnotexactlyclear.

These MOOCs are offered through special cloud-based software platforms such as Coursera, edX and FutureLearn. xMOOCsis aterm coinedbyStephenDownes(2012)for coursesdevelopedbyCoursera,Udacity andedX.Atthetimeofwriting(2019)xMOOCsarebyfarthemostcommonMOOC.Instructorshave considerableflexibilityinthedesignofthecourse,sothereisconsiderablevariationinthedetails,but in general xMOOCshave the following common design features: 5.3.1.1Specially designed platform software Mostvery large xMOOCs usespecially designed platform software such as Coursera, edX or FutureLearn that allows for the registration of very large numbers of participants, provides facilities for the storing and streaming on demand of digital materials, and automates assessment procedures and student performance tracking. The software platform also allows the companies that provide the software to collect and analyse student data. However, more and more smaller institutions are offering their own xMOOCs through using or adapting their continuing education onlineregistration process,their ownvideo servers,and‘off-the.shelf’ automated feedback, testing and marking tools. 5.3.1.2Video lectures xMOOCs use the standard lecture mode, delivered online byparticipants downloading on demand recordedvideolectures.Thesevideolecturesarenormallyavailableonaweeklybasisoveraperiodof 10-13weeks.Initiallythesewereoften50minutelectures,butasaresultofexperiencesomexMOOCs nowareusingshorterrecordings(sometimesdownto15minutesinlength)andthustheremaybemore videosegments.Aswell,xMOOCcourses arebecomingshorterinlength,somenowlastingonlyfive weeks. Various video production methods have been used, includinglecture capture (recording face-to-faceon-campuslectures,thenstoringthemandstreamingthemondemand),fullstudioproduction, ordesk-top recording by the instructor. 5.3.1.3 Computer-marked assignments Studentscompleteanonlinetestandreceiveimmediatecomputerisedfeedback.Thesetestsareusually offeredthroughout the course, and may be used just for participant feedback. Alternatively the tests maybeusedfordeterminingtheawardofacertificate.Anotheroptionisforanendofcoursegradeor certificate based solely on an end-of-course online test. Most xMOOC assignments are based on multiple-choice,computer-markedquestions,butsomeMOOCshavealsousedtextorformulaboxesfor participantstoenteranswers,suchascodinginacomputersciencecourse,ormathematicalformulae, and in one or two cases, short text answers, but in most cases these will be computer-marked. 5.3.1.4 Peer assessment Some xMOOCs have experimented with assigningstudents randomly to small groups for peer assessment, especially for more open-ended ormore evaluative assignment questions. This has often provedproblematicthoughbecauseofwidevariationsinexpertisebetweenthedifferentmembersofa group, and because of the different levels of involvement in the course of different participants. 5.3.1.5Supporting materials Sometimescopiesofslides,supplementaryaudiofiles,urlstootherresources,andonlinearticlesmay be included for downloading by participants. 5.3.1.6Ashared comment/discussion space Theseareplaceswhereparticipantscanpostquestions,askforhelp,orcommentonthecontentofthe course. 5.3.1.7 No, or very light, discussion moderation The extentto which the discussion or comments are moderated varies probably morethan any other featureinxMOOCs,butatitsmost,moderationisdirectedatallparticipantsratherthantoindividuals. Becauseoftheverylargenumbersparticipatingandcommenting,moderationofindividualcomments by the instructor(s) offering the MOOC is rarelypossible. Some instructors offer no moderation whatsoever, so participants rely on other participants to respond to questions or comments. Some instructors‘sample’commentsandquestions,andpostcommentsinresponsetothese.Someinstructors usevolunteersorpaidteachingassistantstocombcommentstoidentifycommonareasofconcernshared byanumberofparticipantsthentheinstructorand/ortheteachingassistantswillrespond.However,in most cases, participants moderate each other’s comments or questions. 5.3.1.8Badges or certificates Most xMOOCs award some kind of recognition for successful completion of a course, based on a finalcomputer-markedassessment.However,atthetimeofwriting,MOOCbadgesorcertificateshave in most cases notbeen recognised for credit or admission purposes even by the institutions offering a MOOC – even when the lectures are the same as for on-campus students. Little evidence exists to date about employer acceptance of MOOC qualifications (see for instance, Banks and Meinart, 2016or Gatuguta-Gitau, 2017). However, with the increasing development of partnerships between majoremployersandMOOCproviderstodevelopmicrocredentials,thismaychange(seeforexample, Gordon,2018). 5.3.1.9 Learning analytics Although to date there has not been a great deal of published information about the use of learning analyticsinxMOOCs,thexMOOCplatformshavethecapacitytocollectandanalyse‘bigdata’about participants andtheir performance, enabling, atleastintheory, forimmediate feedback toinstructors aboutareaswherethecontentordesignneedsimprovingandpossiblydirectingautomatedcuesorhints for individuals. For examples of the use of learning analytics in MOOCs, see Laveti et al., 2017 or Eradze and Tammets,2017. 5.3.1.10xMOOCs Summary xMOOCstherefore primarily use a teaching model focused on the transmission of information, with high quality content delivery, computer-marked assessment (mainly for student feedback purposes), andautomationofallkeytransactionsbetweenparticipantsandthelearningplatform.Thereisrarely anydirect interaction between an individual participant and theinstructor responsible for the course, althoughinstructorsmaypostgeneralcommentsinresponsetoarangeofparticipants’comments.Thus there is a highly behaviouristic/objectivist epistemology underlying xMOOCs. 5.3.2cMOOCs cMOOCs, the first of which was developed by three instructors for a course at the University of Manitoba in 2008, are based on network learning, where learning develops through the connections anddiscussionsbetweenparticipants oversocialmedia.Thereis nostandardtechnologyplatformfor cMOOCs,whichuseacombinationofwebcasts,participantblogs,tweets,softwarethatconnectsblogs andtweets onthesametopicvia hashtags,and online discussion forums.Althoughusuallythere are someexpertswhoinitiateandparticipateincMOOCs,theyarebyandlargedrivenbytheinterestsand contributions of the participants. Usually there is no attempt at formal assessment. 5.3.2.1 Key design principles for cMOOCs Downes (2014) has identified four key design principles forcMOOCs: • autonomy of the learner: although whoeverorganises the MOOC will usually choose a main topic and invite participants, there isno formal curriculum; participants decidewhat to discuss, what to read, and what they wish to contribute towards the topic; • diversity: in the tools used, the range of participants, their knowledge levels, and the varied content; • interactivity: in terms ofco-operative learning, communication between participants, resulting in ’emergent’ knowledge • open-ness:in terms of access, content, activities and assessment. ThusfortheproponentsofcMOOCs,learningresultsnotfromthetransmissionofinformationfroman expert to novices, as in xMOOCs, but from the sharing and flow of knowledge between participants. 5.3.2.2 From principles to practice Identifying how these key design features for cMOOCs are turned into practice is somewhat more difficulttopinpoint,becausecMOOCsdependonanevolvingsetofpractices.MostcMOOCstodate have in fact made some use of ‘experts’, both in theorganization and promotion of theMOOC, and inproviding‘nodes’ofcontent aroundwhichdiscussiontends torevolve. Inotherwords,thedesign practicesof cMOOCs are still more a work in progress than those of xMOOCs. Nevertheless, at the moment the following arekey design practices in cMOOCs: • use of social media Partlybecause most cMOOCs are not institutionally based or supported, they do not at present use a sharedplatform or platforms but are more loosely supported by a range of openly accessible ‘connected’ tools and media. These may include asimpleonline registration system, and the use of web conferencing tools such as Blackboard Collaborate or Adobe Connect, streamed video or audio files, blogs, wikis, ‘open’ learning management systems such as Moodle or Canvas, Twitter, LinkedIn or Facebook,all enabling participants to share their contributions. Indeed, as new apps and social media tools develop, they too are likely to be incorporated into cMOOCs. All these tools are connected through web-based hashtags or other web-basedlinking mechanisms, enabling participants to identify social media contributions from other participants.Thusthe use of loosely linked or connected social media is a key design component of cMOOCs; • participant-driven content In principle, other than a common topic that may be decided by someone wanting to organise a cMOOC, content is decided upon and contributed by the participants themselves. Indeed, there may be no formally identified instructor. In practice though cMOOC organisers (who themselves tend to have some expertise in the topic of the MOOC) are likelyto invite potential participants who have expertise or are known already to have a well articulated approach to a topic, to make contributions which form the basis of discussion and debate. Participants choose their own ways to contribute or communicate, the most common being through blogposts, tweets, or comments on other participants’ blog posts, although some cMOOCs use wikis oropen sourceonline discussion forums. The key design practicewith regard to content is that all participants contribute to and share content; • distributed communication This is probably the most difficult design practiceto understand for those not familiar with cMOOCs – and even for those who have participated. With participants numbering in the hundreds or even thousands, each contributing individually through a variety of social media, there are a myriad different inter-connections between participants that are impossible to track (in total) byany single participant. This results in many sub-conversations, more commonly atabinary level of two people communicating with each other than an integrated group discussion, although all conversations are ‘open’ and all other participants are able to contribute to a conversation if they know it exists. The key design practicethen with regard to communication isa self-organising network with many sub-components; • assessment There is no formal assessment, although participants may seek feedback from other, more knowledgeable participants, on an informal basis. Basically participants decide for themselves whether what they have learned is appropriate to them. 5.3.2.3cMOOCs summary cMOOCs therefore primarily use a networked approach to learning based on autonomous learners connectingwitheachotheracrossopenandconnectedsocialmediaandsharingknowledgethroughtheir ownpersonalcontributions.Thereisnopre-setcurriculumandnoformalteacher-studentrelationship, eitherfordeliveryofcontentorforlearnersupport.Participantslearnfromthecontributionsofothers, fromthemeta-levelknowledgegeneratedthroughthecommunity,andfromself-reflectionontheirown contributions, thus reflecting many of the features of communities of interest or practice. cMOOCshave averydifferenteducationalphilosophyfromxMOOCs. DownesandSiemenshave arguedthatcMOOCsreflectanewtheoryoflearning,‘connectivism’,basedonexploitingonlinesocial networks (seeChapter 2.6). cMOOCs certainly reflect a constructivist epistemology. 5.3.3 Othervariations of MOOCs IhavedeliberatelyfocusedonthedifferencesindesignbetweenxMOOCsandcMOOCs,andMackness (2103)and Yousef et al. (2014)also emphasise similardifferences in philosophy/theory between cMOOCs and xMOOCs, as well as Downes himself (2012), one of the original designers of cMOOCs. However, it should be noted that the design of MOOCs continues to evolve, with all kinds of variations.Pilli and Admiraal (2016) have identified 27 types of MOOC, including: • cMOOCs; • xMOOCs; • BOOCs (a big open online course) – a cross between an xMOOC and a cMOOC; • COOCs (community open online courses) –small-scale, non-profit courses that corporations open online to provide courses for customers and/or employees • DOCCs (distributed open collaborative course): this involves 17 universities sharing and adapting the same basic MOOC; • LOOC s(little open online course): as well as 15-20 tuition-paying campus-based students, suchcourses also allow a limited number of non-registered students to also take the course, but also paying a fee; • MOORs (massive open online research): a mix of video-based lecturers and student research projects guided by the instructors; • SPOCs (small, private, online courses): the example given is from Harvard Law School, which pre-selected 500 students from over 4,000 applicants, who take the same video-delivered lectures as on-campus students enrolled at Harvard; The MOOCs developed by the University of British Columbia and a number of other institutions usevolunteers,paidacademicassistants oreventheinstructor tomoderatetheonlinediscussionsand participant comments, making such MOOCs closer in design toregular for-credit online courses – except that they are open to anyone. 5.3.4What’s going on here? It is notsurprising that overtime,the design ofMOOCs is evolving.There seemtobethreedistinct kinds of development: • some of the newer MOOCs, especially those from institutions with a history of credit-based online learning prior to the introduction of MOOCs, are beginning to apply some of the best practices, such as organised and moderated discussion groups, from online credit courses to MOOCs (seeChapter 4, Section 4); • others are trying to open up their regular campus classes also, simultaneously, to non-registered students (which in fact is how the first MOOC, from Cormier, Downes and Siemens, originated); • yet others are trying to blend online MOOC materials or content with their on-campus teaching. ItislikelythatinnovationinMOOCdesignandthewayMOOCsareusedwillcontinue.Inparticular, differentkindsofMOOCcomeandgo.FindingextantexamplesofsomeofthetypesofMOOClisted in Section 5.3.3 has been difficult in revising this chapter. However, some of these developments also indicate a good deal of confusion around the definitionandgoals ofMOOCs,especially regarding massivenessandopen-ness.Ifparticipantsfrom outsideauniversityhavetopayaheftyfeetoparticipateinanotherwise‘closed’,on-campuscourse,or ifoff-campusparticipantshavetobeselectedoncertaincriteriabeforetheycanparticipate,isitreally open?IsthetermMOOCnowbeingusedtodescribeanyunconventionalonlineofferingoranyonline continuingeducationcourse?It’sdifficulttoseehowaSPOCforinstancediffersfromatypicalonline continuing educationcourse, except perhaps in that it uses a recorded lecture rather than a learning management system. There is adanger of having any online course ending up being described as a MOOC, when in fact there are major differences in design and philosophy. Although each of these individual innovations, often the result of theinitiative of an individual instructor,aretobewelcomedinprinciple,theconsequencesneedtobecarefullyconsideredinfairness to potential participants. Individual instructors designing MOOCs really need to make sure that the design is consistent in terms of educational philosophy, and beclear asto why they are opting for a MOOCratherthanaconventionalonlinecourse.Thisisparticularlyimportantifthereistobeanyform offormalassessment.Thestatusofsuchanassessmentforparticipantswhoarenotformallyadmitted to orregistered as a student in an institution needs to be clear and consistent. Thereis evenmoreconfusionaboutmixingMOOCswithon-campusteaching.Atthe momentthe strategyappearstobetofirstdevelopaMOOCthenseehowitcanbeadaptedforon-campusteaching.

Groves, Ph.D. student My big concern with xMOOCs is their limitation, as currently designed, for developing the higher order intellectual skills needed in a digital world. Tony Bates 5.4.1 Theresearch on MOOCs At the time of writing (2019), MOOCs are still less than ten years old, whereas online courses for credithavebeenaroundformorethan20years.Thelatterhavebeensubjecttomuchmoreindependent research,althoughthispriorresearchwaslargelyignoredinthedesignoftheearlyMOOCs.Alotofthe 229 researchtodateonMOOCscomesfromtheinstitutionsofferingMOOCs,mainlyintheformofreports onenrolments,orself-evaluationbyinstructors.ThecommercialplatformproviderssuchasCoursera and Udacity have provided limited research informationoverall, which is a pity, because they have accesstoreallybigdatasets.However,MITandHarvard,thefoundingpartnersinedX,areconducting some research, mainly on theirown courses. In this chapter, I have drawn on available evidence-based research that provides insight into the strengthsandweaknessesofMOOCs.Atthe sametime,weshouldbeclearthat wearediscussinga phenomenonthattodatehasbeenmarkedlargelybypolitical,emotionalandoftenirrationaldiscourse, rather than something based on evidence-based research. Lastly,itshouldberememberedinthisevaluationIamapplyingthecriteriaofwhetherMOOCsare likelytoleadtothekindsoflearningneededinadigitalage:inotherwords,dotheyhelpdevelopthe knowledge and skills defined inChapter 1? 5.4.2Open and free education 5.4.2.1 The ‘open-ness’ of MOOCs MOOCs,particularlyxMOOCs,deliverhighqualitycontentfromsomeoftheworld’sbestuniversities toanyonewithacomputerandanInternetconnection.Thisinitselfisanamazingvalueproposition.In this sense, MOOCs are an incredibly valuable addition to education.Who could argue against this? However,MOOCsarenottheonlyformofopenandfreeeducation.Libraries,opentextbooksand educationalbroadcastingarealsoopenandfreeandhavebeenforsometime.Therearealsolessonswe can learn from these earlierforms of open and free education that also apply to MOOCs. Furthermore,MOOCsarenotalwaysopenasinthesenseofopeneducationalresources.Courseraand Udacityforinstanceofferlimitedaccesstotheirmaterialforre-usewithoutpermission.Onothermore openplatforms,such asedX,individualfaculty orinstitutionsmayrestrict re-useofmaterial.Lastly, manyMOOCsexistforonlyoneortwoyearsthendisappear,whichlimitstheiruseasopeneducational resources for re-use in other courses or programs. 5.4.2.2 A replacement for conventional education? Itisworthnotingthattheseearlierformsofopenandfreeeducationdidnotreplacetheneedforformal, credit-basededucation,butwereusedtosupplementorstrengthenit.Inotherwords,MOOCsareatool forcontinuingandinformaleducation,whichhashighvalueinitsownright.Asweshallsee,though, MOOCs work best when people are already reasonably well educated. There is noreason to believe thenthatbecauseMOOCsareopenandfree toend-users,theywillinevitablyforcedownthe costof conventional higher education, or eliminate the need for it altogether. 5.4.2.3 The answer for education in developing countries? There have been many attempts to use educational broadcasting and satellite broadcasting in developingcountriestoopenupeducationforthemasses(seeBates,1984),andtheyallsubstantially failed to increase access or reduce costfor a variety of reasons, the most important being: • the high cost of ground equipment (including security from theft or damage); • the need for local face-to-face support for learners without high levels of education; • the need to adapt content to the culture and needs of the receiving countries; • the difficulty of covering the operational costs of management and administration, especially for assessment, qualifications and local accreditation. Also the priority in most developingcountries is not for university courses from high-level Stanford University professors,but for low cost, good quality high school education. Althoughmobilephonesand toalesserextenttabletsarewidespreadinAfrica,they arerelatively expensivetouse.Forinstance,it costsUS$2todownloadatypicalYouTubevideo –equivalenttoa day’s salary for many Africans. Streamed 50 minute video lectures then have limited applicability. Lastly, it is frankly immoral to allow people in developing countries to believe that successful completionofMOOCswillleadtoarecogniseddegreeortouniversityentranceintheUSAorinany other economically advanced country, at least under present circumstances. This is not to say that MOOCs could not be valuable in developingcountries, butthis will mean: • being realistic as to what theycan actually deliver; • working in partnership with educational institutions and systems and other partners in developing countries; • ensuring that the necessary localsupport – which costs real money – is put in place; • adapting the design, content and delivery of MOOCs to the cultural and economic requirements ofthose countries. Finally,althoughMOOCsareinthemainfreeforparticipants,theyarenotwithoutsubstantialcostto MOOC providers, an issue that will be discussed in more detail in Section 5.4.8. 5.4.3 The audience that MOOCs mainly serve InaresearchreportfromHoetal.(2014),researchersatHarvardUniversityandMITfoundthatonthe first 17 MOOCs offered through edX, • 66per centof all participants, and 74per centof all who obtained a certificate, have a bachelor’s degree or above, • 71 per cent were male, and the average age was 26. • this and other studies also found that a high proportion ofparticipantscame from outside the USA, ranging from 40-60per centof all participants, indicating strong interestinternationally inopen access to high quality university teaching. In a studybased on over 80 interviews in 62 institutions ‘active in the MOOC space’, Hollands and Tirthali(2014), researchers at Columbia University Teachers’ College, found that: Data from MOOC platforms indicate that MOOCs are providing educational opportunities to millions of individuals across the world. However, most MOOC participants are already well-educated and employed, and only a small fraction of them fully engages with the courses. Overall, the evidence suggests that MOOCs are currently falling far short of “democratizing” education and may, for now, be doing more to increase gaps in access to education than to diminish them. ThusMOOCs,asiscommonwithmostformsofuniversitycontinuingeducation,catertothebetter educated, older and employed sectors of society. 5.4.4 Persistence and commitment: the onion hypothesis TheedXresearchers(Hoetal.,2014)identifieddifferentlevelsofcommitmentasfollowsacross17edX MOOCs: • only registered: registrants who never access the courseware (35per cent); • only viewed: non-certified registrants who access the courseware, accessing less than half of the available chapters (56per cent); • only explored: non-certified registrants who access more than half of the available chapters in the courseware, but did not get a certificate (4per cent); • certified: registrants who earn a certificate in the course (5per cent). Hill (2013) has identified five types of participants in Coursera courses: Engle(2014) foundsimilar patterns (also replicated in other studies) for the University of British Columbia MOOCs on Coursera : • of those that initially sign up, between one third and a half do not participate in any other active way; • of those that participate in at least one activity, between 5-10per centgo on to successfully complete a certificate. Thosegoingontoachievecertificatesusuallyarewithinthe5-10percentrangeofthosethatsignupand inthe10-20percentrangeforthosewhoactivelyengagedwiththeMOOCatleastonce.Nevertheless, thenumbersobtainingcertificatesarestilllargeinabsoluteterms:over43,000across17coursesonedX and 8,000 across four courses at UBC (between 2,000-2,500 certificates per course). Milliganetal.(2013)foundasimilarpatternofcommitmentincMOOCs,frominterviewingasmall sample of participants (29 out of 2,300 registrants) about halfway through acMOOC: • passive participants: in Milligan’s study these were those that felt lost in the MOOC and rarely but occasionally logged in; • lurkers: they were actively following the course but did not engage in any of the activities (just under half those interviewed); • active participants (again, just under half those interviewed) who were fully engaged in the course activities. MOOCsneedtobejudgedforwhattheyare,asomewhatunique–andvaluable–formofnon-formal education.These results are very similar to research into non-formal educational broadcasts (e.g. the HistoryChannel).OnewouldnotexpectaviewertowatcheveryepisodeofaHistoryChannelseries thentakeanexamattheend.Hoetal.(p.13)producedthefollowingdiagramtoshowthedifferentlevels of commitment to xMOOCs: Figure 5.4.3 Level of participation in MOOCs © Ho et al., 2014 This is remarkably similar to what I wrote in 1984 about the onion hypothesis of educational broadcasting in Britain (Bates,1984): (p.99):At the centre of the onion is a small core of fully committed students who work through the whole course, and, where available, take an end-of-course assessment or examination. Around the small core will be a rather larger layer of students who do not take any examination but do enrol with a local class or correspondence school. There may be an even larger layer of students who, as well as watching and listening, also buy the accompanying textbook, but who do not enrol in any courses. Then, by far the largest group, are those that just watch or listen to the programmes. Even within this last group, there will be considerable variations, from those who watch or listen fairly regularly, to those, again a much larger number, who watch or listen to just one programme. I also wrote (p.100): A sceptic may say that the only ones who can be said to have learned effectively are the tiny minority that worked right through the course and successfully took the final assessment…A counter argument would be that broadcasting can be considered successful if it merely attracts viewers or listeners who might otherwise have shown no interest in the topic; it is the numbers exposed to the material that matter…the key issue then is whether broadcasting does attract to education those who would not otherwise have been interested, or merely provides yet another opportunity for those who are already well educated…There is a good deal of evidence that it is still the better educated in Britain and Europe that make the most use of non-formal educational broadcasting. ExactlythesamecouldbesaidaboutMOOCs.Inadigitalagewhereeasyandopenaccesstonew knowledgeiscriticalforthoseworkinginknowledge-basedindustries,MOOCswillbe onevaluable sourceormeansofaccessingthatknowledge.Theissueisthoughwhethertherearemoreeffectiveways todothis.ThusMOOCscanbeconsideredauseful–butnotreallyrevolutionary–contributiontonon.formal continuing education. 5.4.5What do students learn in MOOCs? Thisisamuchmoredifficultquestiontoanswer,becausesolittleoftheresearchtodate(2019)hastried toanswerthisquestion.(Onereason,asweshallseeinthenextsection,isthatassessmentoflearning inMOOCsremainsamajorchallenge).Thereareatleasttwokindsofstudy:quantitativestudiesthat seektoquantifylearninggains;andqualitativestudiesthatdescribetheexperienceoflearnerswithin MOOCs, which indirectly provide some insight into what they have learned. 5.4.5.1Conceptual learning At the time of writing, the most quantitativestudy of learning in MOOCs has beenby Colvin et al.(2014),whoinvestigated‘conceptuallearning’inanMITIntroductoryPhysicsMOOC.Colvinand colleaguescomparedlearnerperformancenotonlybetweendifferentsub-categoriesoflearnerswithin theMOOC,suchasthosewithnophysicsormathbackgroundwiththosesuchasphysicteacherswho hadconsiderable prior knowledge, butalso withon-campusstudents taking the samecurriculumina traditionalcampus teachingformat.Inessence,thestudyfound nosignificantdifferencesinlearning gainsbetweenorwithinthetwotypesofteaching,butitshouldbenotedthattheon-campusstudents were students who had failed an earlier version of the course and were retaking it. This research is a classic example of the no significant difference in comparative studies in educationaltechnology;othervariables,suchasdifferencesinthetypesofstudents,wereasimportant asthemodeofdelivery(formoreonthe‘nosignificantdifference’phenomenoninmediacomparisons, see Chapter 10, Section 2.2).Also, this MOOC design representsa behaviourist-cognitivist approach tolearningthatplacesheavyemphasis oncorrectanswerstoconceptualquestions.Itdoesn’t attempt todevelop the skills needed in a digital age as identified in Chapter 1. 5.4.5.2 The student experience Therehavebeenfarmorestudiesoftheexperience oflearnerswithinMOOCs,particularlyfocusingon thediscussionswithinMOOCs(seeforinstance,Kop,2011).Ingeneral(althoughthereareexceptions), discussions are unmonitored, and it is left to participants to make connections and respond to other students comments. However,therearesomestrongcriticismsoftheeffectivenessofthediscussionelementofMOOCs fordevelopingthehigh-levelconceptualanalysisrequiredforacademiclearning.Thereisevidencefrom studiesofcredit-basedonlinelearningthattodevelopdeep,conceptuallearning,thereisaneedinmost cases forintervention by a subject expert toclarify misunderstandings or misconceptions, to provide accuratefeedback, toensurethatthecriteriaforacademiclearning,such as useofevidence,clarity ofargument,andsoon,arebeingmet,andtoensurethenecessaryinputandguidancetoseekdeeper understanding (see in particular Harasim,2017). Furthermore,themoremassivethecourse,themorelikelyparticipantsaretofeel‘overload,anxiety and a sense of loss’, if there is not some instructor intervention or structure imposed (Knox, 2014). Firminetal.(2014)haveshownthatwhenthereissomeformofinstructor‘encouragementandsupport ofstudenteffortandengagement’,resultsimproveforallparticipantsinMOOCs.Withoutastructured roleforsubjectexperts,participantsarefacedwithawidevarietyofqualityintermsofcommentsand feedback from other participants.There is again a great deal of research on the conditions necessary forthesuccessfulconductofcollaborativeandco-operativegrouplearning(seeforinstance,Laveand Wenger,1991,orBarkley,MajorandCross,2014),andthesefindingscertainlyhavenotbeengenerally applied to the management of MOOC discussions. 5.4.5.3 Networked and collaborative learning Onecounter argument is that cMOOCs in particular develop a new form of learning based on networking and collaboration that is essentially different from academic learning, and cMOOCs are thusmore appropriate to the needs of learners in a digital age. Adult participants in particular, it is claimed by Downes and Siemens, have the ability to self-manage the development of high level conceptuallearning. cMOOCsare‘demand’driven,meetingtheinterestsofindividualstudentswho seekoutotherswithsimilarinterestsandthenecessaryexpertisetosupportthemintheirlearning,and formanythisinterestmaywellnotincludetheneedfordeep,conceptuallearningbutmorelikelythe appropriateapplicationsofpriorknowledgeinneworspecificcontexts.AllMOOCsdoappeartowork bestforthosewhoalreadyhaveahighlevelofeducationandthereforebringmanyoftheconceptual skillsdevelopedinformaleducationwiththemwhentheyjoin aMOOC,andthereforecontribute to helping those who come without such prior knowledge or skills. 5.4.5.4The need for learner support Over time, as more experience is gained, MOOCs are likely to incorporateandadapt some of the findings from research on smaller group work to themuch larger numbers in MOOCs. For instance, someMOOCsareusing‘volunteer’orcommunitytutors.TheUSStateDepartmentorganizedMOOC campsthroughUSmissionsandconsulatesabroadtomentorMOOCparticipants.Thecampsincluded FulbrightscholarsandembassystaffwholeaddiscussionsoncontentandtopicsforMOOCparticipants in countries abroad (Haynie,2014). Some MOOC providers, such as the University of British Columbia, paid a small cohort of academicassistants to monitor and contribute to the MOOC discussion forums (Engle, 2014).Engle reported that theuse of academic assistants, as well as limited but effective interventions from the instructors themselves, made the UBC MOOCs more interactive and engaging. However, paying for people to monitor and support MOOCs will of course increase the cost to providers. Consequently, MOOCs are likely to developnew automated ways to managediscussion effectively in very large groups. For instance, the University of Edinburgh experimented with an automated ‘teacherbot’ that crawled through student and instructor Twitter posts associated with a MOOCanddirectedpredeterminedcommentstostudentstopromptdiscussionandreflection(Bayne, 2015).Theseresultsandapproaches areconsistentwithpriorresearch ontheimportanceofinstructor presence for successful online learning in credit-based courses (seeChapter 4.4.3). Inthemeantime,though,thereismuchworkstilltobedoneifMOOCsaretoprovidethesupportand structureneededtoensuredeep,conceptuallearningwherethisdoesnotalreadyexistinstudents.The developmentoftheskillsneededinadigitalageislikelytobeanevengreaterchallengewhendealing withmassivenumbers.However,weneedmuchmoreresearchintowhatparticipantsactuallylearnin MOOCs and under what conditions before any firm conclusions can be drawn. 5.4.6Assessment AssessmentofthemassivenumbersofparticipantsinMOOCshasprovedtobeamajorchallenge.It is a complex topic that can be dealt with only briefly here. However, Chapter 6, Section 8provides ageneral analysisof different types of assessment, and Suen (2014) provides a comprehensive and balancedoverviewofthewayassessmenthasbeenusedinMOOCstodate.Thissectiondrawsheavily on Suen’s paper. 5.4.6.1 Computer marked assignments Assessment to date in MOOCs has been primarily of two kinds. The first is based on quantitative multiple-choice tests, or response boxes where formulae or ‘correct code’ can be entered and automaticallychecked.Usuallyparticipantsaregivenimmediateautomatedfeedbackontheiranswers, ranging from simple right or wrong answers to more complex responses depending on the type of response checked, but in all cases, the process is usually fully automated. Forstraighttestingoffacts,principles,formulae,equationsandotherformsofconceptuallearning where there are clear, correct answers, this works well. In fact, multiple choice computer marked assignments were usedby theUKOpenUniversity as longago as the1970s, although the means to giveimmediateonlinefeedbackwerenotavailablethen.However,thismethodofassessmentislimited fortestingdeep or‘transformative’learning,andparticularlyweakforassessingtheintellectualskills needed in a digital age, such as creative or original thinking. 5.4.6.2 Peerassessment AnothertypeofassessmentthathasbeentriedinMOOCshasbeenpeerassessment,whereparticipants assess each other’s work. Peer assessment is not new. It has been successfully used for formative assessmentintraditionalclassroomsandinsomeonlineteachingforcredit(FalchikovandGoldfinch, 2000;vanZundertetal.,2010).Moreimportantly,peerassessmentisseenasapowerfulwaytoimprove deepunderstandingandknowledgethroughtheprocessofstudentsevaluatingtheworkofothers,andat thesametime,itcanbeusefulfordevelopingsomeoftheskillsneededinadigitalage,suchascritical thinking, for those participants assessing other participants. However,akeyfeatureofthesuccessfuluseofpeerassessmenthasbeenthecloseinvolvementofan instructororteacher,inprovidingbenchmarks,rubricsorcriteriaforassessment,andformonitoringand adjustingpeerassessmentstoensureconsistencyandamatchwiththebenchmarkssetbytheinstructor. Althoughan instructor can provide the benchmarks and rubrics in MOOCs,close monitoring of the multiplepeerassessmentsisdifficultifnotimpossiblewiththeverylargenumbersofparticipants.As aresult,MOOCparticipantsoftenbecomeincensed atbeingrandomlyassessedbyotherparticipants whomaynotandoftendonothavetheknowledgeorabilitytogivea‘fair’oraccurateassessmentof another participant’s work. VariousattemptstogetroundthelimitationsofpeerassessmentinMOOCshavebeentriedsuchas calibrated peer reviews, based on averaging all the peer ratings, and Bayesian post hoc stabilization (Piechatal.2013),butalthoughthesestatisticaltechniquesreducetheerror(orspread)ofpeerreview somewhat they still do not remove the problems of systematic errors of judgement in raters due to misconceptions.Thisisparticularly aproblemwhere amajorityofparticipantsfail tounderstandkey concepts in aMOOC, in which case peer assessment becomes the blind leading the blind. 5.4.6.3 Automated essay scoring Thisisanotherareawheretherehavebeenattemptstoautomatescoring(Balfour,2013).Althoughsuch methods are increasingly sophisticated they are currently limited in terms of accurate assessment to measuringprimarilytechnicalwritingskills,suchasgrammar,spellingandsentenceconstruction.Once again they do not measure accurately longer essays where higher level intellectual skills are demanded. 5.4.6.4Badges, certificatesand microcredentials Particularly in xMOOCs, participants may be awarded a certificate or a ‘badge’ for successful completionoftheMOOC,based onafinaltest(usuallycomputer-marked)which measuresthelevel oflearningin acourse.However, mostoftheinstitutionsofferingMOOCswill notaccept theirowncertificatesforadmissionorcreditwithintheirown,campus-basedprograms. Probablynothingsays moreabouttheconfidenceinthequalityofthe assessmentthan this failure of MOOC providers to recognize their own teaching. MOOC-based microcredentials are a more recent development.A microcredential is any one of a numberofnewcertificationsthatcoversmorethanasinglecoursebutislessthanafulldegree.Pickard (2018) provides an analysis of more than 450 MOOC-based microcredentials.Pickard states: Microcredentials can be seen as part of a trend toward modularity and stackability in higher education, the idea being that each little piece of an education can be consumed on its own or can be aggregated with other pieces up to something larger. Each course is made of units, each unit is made of lessons; courses can stack up to Specializations or XSeries; these can stack up to partial degrees such as MicroMasters, or all the way up to full degrees (though only some microcredentials are structured as pieces of degrees). However,inheranalysis,Pickardfoundthatinthemicro-credentialsofferedthroughthemainMOOC platforms, such as Coursera, edX, Udacity and FutureLearn.; • student fees range from US$250 to US$17,000; • some microcredentials, though not all, offer some opportunity to earn credit towards a degree program. Typically, university credit is awarded if and only if a student goes on to enroll in the particular degree program connected with the microcredential; • they are not accredited, recognized, or evaluated by third party organizations (except insofar as they pertain to university degree programs). This variability and lack of standardization poses a problem for both learners and employers, as it makes it difficult to compare the various microcredentials; • with so much variability, how would a prospective learner choose among the various options? Furthermore, without a detailed understanding of these options, how would an employer interpret or compare these microcredentials when they come up on a resume? Nevertheless, in a digital age, both workers and employers will increasingly look for ways to ‘accredit’ smaller units of learning than a degree, but in ways that they can be stacked towards eventually a full degree. The issue is whether tying this to the MOOC movement is the best way to go. Surely a better way would be to develop microcredentials as part of or in parallel with a regular online masters program. For instance as early as 2003, the University of British Columbia in its online Master of Educational Technology was allowing students to take single courses at a time, or the five foundation courses for a post-graduate certificate, or add four more courses and a project to the certificate for a full Master’s degree. Such microcredentials would not be MOOCs, unless (a) they are open to anyone and (b) they are free or at such a low cost anyone can take them. Then the issue becomes whether the institution will accept such MOOC-like credentials as part of a full degree. If not, employers are unlikely torecognise such microcredentials, because they will not know what they are worth. 5.4.6.5The intent behind assessment ToevaluateassessmentinMOOCsrequiresanexaminationoftheintentbehindassessment.Thereare manydifferentpurposesbehindassessment(seeChapter6,Section8).Peerassessmentandimmediate feedbackon computer-marked tests can beextremelyvaluablefor formative assessment or feedback, enablingparticipantstoseewhattheyhaveunderstoodandtohelpdevelopfurthertheirunderstanding ofkeyconcepts.IncMOOCs,asSuenpointsout,learningismeasuredasthecommunicationthattakes placebetweenMOOCparticipants,resultingincrowdsourcedvalidationofknowledge –it’s whatthe sum of all the participants come to believe to be true as a result of participating in the MOOC, so formalassessmentisunnecessary.However,whatislearnedinthiswayisnotnecessarilyacademically validated knowledge, which to be fair, is not the concern of cMOOCproponents. Academicassessmentisaformofcurrency,relatednotonlyto measuringstudentachievementbut alsoaffectingstudentmobility(forexample,entrancetograduateschool)andperhapsmoreimportantly employmentopportunitiesandpromotion.Fromalearner’sperspective,thevalidityofthecurrency – therecognitionandtransferabilityofthequalification–isessential.Todate,MOOCshavebeenunable todemonstratethattheyareabletoassessaccuratelythelearningachievementsofparticipantsbeyond comprehensionandknowledgeofideas,principlesandprocesses(recognizingthatthereissomevalue inthisalone).WhatMOOCshavenotbeenabletodemonstrateisthattheycaneitherdeveloporassess deepunderstandingortheintellectualskillsrequiredinadigitalage.Indeed,thismaynotbepossible withintheconstraintsofmassiveness,whichistheirmajordistinguishingfeaturefromotherformsof online learning. 5.4.7 Branding Hollands and Tirthali (2014) in their survey on institutional expectations for MOOCs, found that buildingandmaintainingbrandwasthesecondmostimportantreasonforinstitutionslaunchingMOOCs (the most important was extending reach, which can also be seen as partly a branding exercise). InstitutionalbrandingthroughtheuseofMOOCshasbeenhelpedbyeliteIvyLeagueuniversitiessuch asStanford,MIT and Harvardleading the charge, and by Coursera limiting accessto its platform to only ‘top tier’ universities. This of course has led to a bandwagon effect, especially since many of theuniversitieslaunchingMOOCshadpreviouslydisdainedtomoveintocredit-basedonlinelearning. MOOCsprovidedawayfortheseeliteinstitutionstojumptotheheadofthequeueintermsofstatus as‘innovators’ of online learning, even though they arrived late to the party. Itobviouslymakes senseforinstitutions touseMOOCstobringtheir areas ofspecialist expertise to a much wider public, such as the University of Alberta offering a MOOC on dinosaurs, MIT on electronics,andHarvardonAncientGreekHeroes.MOOCscertainlyhelptowidenknowledgeofthe qualityofanindividualprofessor(whoisusuallydelightedtoreachmorestudentsinoneMOOCthan inalifetimeofon-campusteaching).MOOCsarealsoagoodwaytogiveaglimpseofthequalityof courses and programs offered by an institution. However,itisdifficulttomeasuretherealimpactofMOOCsonbranding.AsHollandsandTirthali put it: While many institutions have received significant media attention as a result of their MOOC activities, isolating and measuring impact of any new initiative on brand is a difficult exercise. Most institutions are only just beginning to think about how to capture and quantify branding-related benefits. In particular,these elite institutions do not need MOOCs to boost the number of applicants for theircampus-basedprograms(nonetodateiswillingtoacceptsuccessfulcompletionofaMOOCfor admission to credit programs), sinceelite institutions have no difficulty in attracting already highly qualified students. Furthermore, once every other institution starts offering MOOCs, the branding effect gets lost to some extent. Indeed, exposingpoorqualityteaching orcourseplanning to manythousands can have anegativeimpact onaninstitution’s brand,asGeorgiaInstituteofTechnologyfoundwhen oneofits MOOCscrashedandburned(Jaschik,2013).However,byandlarge,mostMOOCssucceedinthesense ofbringinganinstitution’sreputationintermsofknowledgeandexpertisetomanymorepeoplethanit would throughany other form of teaching or publicity. 5.4.8Costs and economies of scale Figure 5.4.8 The MOOC value proposition is that MOOCs can eliminate the variable costs of course delivery.

TherearetwoimportantfeaturesconcerningtheUBCMOOCsthatdo notnecessarilyapply toother MOOCs. First, the UBC MOOCs used awidevariety of video production methods, fromfull studio production to desktop recording, so development costs varied considerably, depending on the sophisticationofthevideoproductiontechnique.Second,theUBCMOOCsmadeextensiveuseofpaid academicassistants,whomonitoreddiscussionsandadaptedorchangedcoursematerialsasaresultof student feedback, so there were substantial delivery costs as well. AppendixBoftheUBCreportgivesapilottotalof$217,657,butthisexcludesacademicassistance or, perhapsthe mostsignificantcost,instructortime.Academicassistance cameto25per centofthe overallcostinthefirstyear(excluding thecostoffaculty).Workingfromthevideoproduction costs ($95,350)andtheproportionofcosts(44percent)devotedtovideoproductioninFigure1inthereport, Iestimatethedirectcostat$216,700,orapproximately$54,000perMOOC,excluding facultytimeand co-ordinationsupport(thatis,excludingprogramadministrationandoverheads),butincludingacademic assistance.However,therangeofcostisalmostasimportant.ThevideoproductioncostsfortheMOOC whichusedintensivestudioproductionweremorethansixtimesthevideoproductioncostsofoneof the other MOOCs. 5.4.8.2 The comparative costs of credit-based online courses The main cost factors or variables in credit-based online and distance learning are relatively well understood,frompreviousresearchbyRumble (2001)andHülsmann(2003).Using asimilarcosting methodology,Itrackedandanalysedthecostofanonlinemaster’sprogramattheUniversityofBritish Columbia over a seven year period (Bates and Sangrà, 2011). This program used mainly a learning managementsystemasthecoretechnology,withinstructorsbothdevelopingthecourseandproviding onlinelearnersupportandassessment,assistedwherenecessaryby extraadjunctfacultyforhandling larger class enrolments. I found in my analysis of the costs of the UBC program that in 2003, development costs were approximately $20,000 to $25,000 per course. However, over a seven year period, course developmentconstitutedlessthan15percentofthetotalcost,andoccurredmainlyinthefirstyearorso oftheprogram.Deliverycosts,whichincludedprovidingonlinelearnersupportandstudentassessment, constitutedmorethanathirdofthetotalcost,andofcoursecontinuedeachyearthecoursewasoffered. Thusincredit-basedonlinelearning,deliverycoststendtobemorethandoublethedevelopmentcosts over the life of a program. ThemaindifferencethenbetweenMOOCs,credit-basedonlineteaching,andcampus-basedteaching isthatinprincipleMOOCseliminatealldeliverycosts,becauseMOOCsdonotprovidelearnersupport or instructor-delivered assessment, although again in practice this is not always true. 5.4.8.3Opportunity costs There is also clearly a large opportunity cost involved in offering xMOOCs. By definition, the most highlyvaluedfacultyareinvolvedinofferingMOOCs.Inalargeresearchuniversity,suchfacultyare likelytohave,atamaximum,ateachingloadoffourtosixcoursesayear.Althoughmostinstructors volunteertodoMOOCs,theirtimeislimited.Eitherit meansdroppingonecreditcourseforatleast onesemester, equivalent to25 per cent ormoreoftheir teaching load, orxMOOCdevelopment and deliveryreplacestimespentdoingresearch.Furthermore,unlikecredit-basedcourses,whichrunfrom anywhere between five to seven years, MOOCs are often offered only once or twice. 5.4.8.4Comparing the cost of MOOCs with online credit courses Howeveronelooksatit,the costofxMOOCdevelopment, without includingthetimeoftheMOOC instructor, tends to be almost double the cost of developing an online credit course using a learning managementsystem,becauseofthe useofvideoinMOOCs.Ifthe costoftheinstructorisincluded, xMOOC production costs come closer to three times that of a similar length online credit course, especiallygiventheextratimefacultytendputinforsuchapublicdemonstrationoftheirteachingin aMOOC.xMOOCscould(andsomedo)usecheaperproductionmethods,suchasanLMSinsteadof video,for contentdelivery, orusingandre-editingvideorecordingsofclassroomlecturesvialecture capture. Withoutlearnersupportoracademicassistance,though,deliverycostsforMOOCsarezero,andthis iswherethehugepotentialforsavingsexist.IfthecostperparticipantiscalculatedtheMOOCunitcosts areverylow, combiningbothproductionanddelivery costs.Evenifthe costperstudentsuccessfully obtaininganendofcoursecertificateiscalculateditwillbemanytimeslowerthanthecostofanonline orcampus-basedsuccessfulstudent.IfwetakeaMOOCcostingroughly$100,000todevelop,and5,000 participantscomplete the end of course certificate, the average cost persuccessful participant is $20. However,thisassumesthatthesametypeofknowledgeandskillsisbeingassessedforbothaMOOC and for a graduate masters program; usuallythis not the case. 5.4.8.5 Costs versus outputs Theissue then is whether MOOCs can succeed without the cost of learner support and human assessment,ormorelikely,whetherMOOCscansubstantiallyreducedeliverycoststhroughautomation withoutlossofqualityinlearnerperformance.Thereisnoevidencetodatethoughthattheycandothis intermsofhigherorderlearningskillsand‘deep’knowledge.Toassessthiskindoflearningrequires setting assignments that test such knowledge, and such assessmentsusually need human marking, which then adds to cost. We alsoknow from prior research fromsuccessful online credit programs thatactiveinstructoronlinepresenceis acriticalfactorforsuccessfulonlinelearning.Thusadequate learnersupportand assessmentremains amajorchallengeforMOOCs.MOOCsthen areagoodway to teachcertain levels of knowledge but will have major structural problems in teaching other types ofknowledge.Unfortunately,itisthetypeofknowledgemostneededinadigitalworldthatMOOCs struggle to teach. 5.4.8.6MOOC business models and cost-benefits Intermsofsustainablebusinessmodels,BakerandPassmore(2016)examinedseveraldifferentpossible businessmodels tosupportMOOCs(butdo notofferanyactualcosting). Theeliteuniversities have beenable tomoveintoxMOOCsbecauseofgenerousdonationsfromprivatefoundationsand useof endowmentfunds,buttheseformsoffunding arelimitedfor mostinstitutions.CourseraandUdacity havetheopportunity todevelopsuccessfulbusinessmodelsthroughvariousmeans,such ascharging MOOC providerinstitutionsfor use of their platform, by collecting fees for badges or certificates, through the sale of participant data, through corporate sponsorship, or through direct advertising. However, particularlyforpubliclyfundeduniversities orcolleges,mostofthese sourcesofincome are not available or permitted, so it is hard to see how they can begin to recover the cost of a substantialinvestment in MOOCs, even with ‘cannibalising’ MOOC material for or from on-campus use. Every time a MOOC is offered, this takes away resources that could be used for online credit programs.Thusinstitutionsarefacedwithsomeharddecisionsaboutwheretoinvesttheirresourcesfor onlinelearning.ThecaseforputtingscarceresourcesintoMOOCsisfarfromclear,unlesssomeway can be found to give credit for successful MOOC completion. 5.4.9Summary of strengths and weaknesses The main points of this analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of MOOCs can be summarised as follows: 5.4.9.1Strengths • MOOCs, particularly xMOOCs, deliver high quality content from some of the world’s best universities for freeor at little costto anyone with a computer and an Internet connection; • MOOCs can be useful for opening access to high quality content, particularly in developingcountries, but to do so successfully will require a good deal of adaptation, and substantial investment in local support and partnerships; • MOOCs are valuable for developing basic conceptual learning, and for creating large online communities of interest or practice; • MOOCs are an extremely valuable form of lifelong learning andcontinuing education; • MOOCs have forced conventional and especially elite institutions to reappraise their strategies towards online and open learning; • institutions have been able to extend their brand and status by making public their expertise and excellence in certain academic areas; • MOOCs main value proposition isto eliminate through computer automation and/or peer-to.peer communicationthe very large variable costs in higher education associated with providing learner support and quality assessment. 5.4.9.2 Weaknesses • the high registration numbers for MOOCs are misleading; less than half of registrants actively participate, and of these, only a small proportion successfully complete the course; nevertheless, absolute numbers completing are still higher than for conventional courses; • MOOCs are expensive to develop, and although commercial organisations offering MOOC platforms have opportunities for sustainable business models, it is difficult to see how publicly funded higher education institutions can develop sustainable business models for MOOCs; • MOOCs tend to attractthose with already a high level of education, rather than widen access; • MOOCs so far have been limited in the ability to develop high level academic learning, or the high level intellectual skills needed in a digital society; • assessment of the higher levels of learning remains a challenge for MOOCs, to the extent that most MOOC providers will not recognise their own MOOCs for credit; • MOOC materials may be limited by copyright or time restrictions for re-use as open educational resources. References Baker, R. and Passmore, D.

It is not surprising that, sincethefirst MOOCfromStanfordprofessorsSebastianThrun,AndrewNgandDaphneKollereachattractedover 200,000sign-upsfromaroundtheworld,sincethecourseswerefree,andsinceitcamefromprofessors atoneofthemostprestigiousprivateuniversitiesintheUSA,theAmericanmediawerealloverit.It was big news in its own right, however you look at it. 5.5.3It’s the Ivy Leagues! Until MOOCs came along, the major Ivy League universities in the USA, such as Stanford, MIT, Harvard and UC Berkeley, as well as many of the most prestigious universities in Canada, such as the University of Toronto and McGill, and elsewhere, had largely ignored online learning in any form (the exception was MIT, which made much of its teaching material available for free via the OpenCourseWare project.). However,by2011,onlinelearning,intheformofforcreditundergraduateandgraduatecourses,was makingbiginroadsatmanyother,veryrespectableuniversities,suchasCarnegieMellon,PennState, andtheUniversityofMarylandintheUSA,andalsoinmanyofthetoptierpublicuniversitiesinCanada and elsewhere, to the extent that one in three students in the USA were were taking online courses (AllenandSeaman,2014).Furthermore,atleastinCanada,theonlinecourseswereoftengettinggood completion rates and matching on-campus courses for quality (Ontario,2011). The Ivy League and other highly prestigious universities that had ignored online learning were beginning to look increasingly out of touch by 2011. By launching into MOOCs, these prestigious universitiescouldjumptotheheadofthequeueintermsoftechnologyinnovation,whileatthesame timeprotectingtheirselectiveandhighlypersonalandhighcostcampusprogramsfromdirectcontact withonlinelearning.Inotherwords,MOOCsgavetheseprestigiousuniversitiesasafesandboxinwhich toexploreonlinelearning.Atthesametime,theinvolvementoftheIvyLeagueuniversitiesinonline learning for the first time gave credibility to MOOCs, and, inadvertently, online learning as a whole. 5.5.4 It’s disruptive! Foryearsbefore2011,variouseconomists,philosophersandindustrialgurushadbeenpredictingthat educationwasthenextbigareafordisruptivechangedue tothe march of newtechnologies (seefor instance Lyotard,1979; Tapscott (undated); Christensen,2016). However,althoughonlinelearningincreditcourseshadbeenquietlyabsorbedintothemainstreamof universityteaching,withoutanysignsofmajordisruption,MOOCswereapotentiallymassivechange, evidence at long last for thetheory of disruption in the education sector. 5.5.5 It’s Silicon Valley! ItisnocoincidencethatthefirstMOOCswerealldevelopedbyentrepreneurialcomputerscientists.Ng andKollerveryquicklywentontocreateCourseraasaprivate,commercialcompany,followedshortly by Thrun, who created Udacity.

They put more care and effort into them. However, we should question why we are teaching in this way on campus.

Unfortunately, xMOOCs are takingthe least appropriate design model for developing 21st century skills fromon-campus teaching, and moving this inappropriate design model online. Just because thelecturescome from elite universities does not necessarily mean that learnerswill develop high level intellectual skills, even though the content is of the highest quality. More importantly, with MOOCs,relativelyfewstudentssucceed,intermsofassessment,andthosethatdoaretestedmainlyon comprehension and limited application of knowledge. We can and have done much better in terms of skills for a digital age with other pedagogical approaches, both on campus, such as problem-or inquiry-based learning, and online usingmore constructivist approaches in credit courses, such as online collaborative learning.

It is not a question of pouringknowledgeintoastudent’shead,butenablingthelearnertodevelopconcepts,thinkcritically, and apply and evaluate what they have learned, by providing opportunities and experiences that are relevant to such goals. The analogy here is gardening. Humans are like plants: all we need to do is to provide the right conditionsforthemtogrow:therightsoil,sufficientsunshineandwater,andhelpeliminatingpestsand weeds.Intermsofhumans,thismeansprovidingsecurity,andthebestconditionsforlearning.Thisisa veryconstructivistviewoftheworld.ThisseemstometobetheapproachofmostcMOOCsandmost earlychildhoodeducation.However,thereislittleattentionpaidtoprioritiesortoefficiencyinlearning. Asecondpremiseisthatknowledgeisnotfixedorstatic,butiscontinuallydeveloping.Ourconcept ofheatchangesandbecomesricheraswegrowolderandbecomemoreeducated,fromunderstanding heat through touch, to providing aquantitative way of measuring it, to understanding its physical properties,tobeingabletoapplythatknowledgetosolvingproblems,suchasdesigningrefrigerators.In aknowledge-basedsociety,knowledgeisconstantlydevelopingandgrowing,andourunderstandingis always developing. 6.1.3 What learning environments do we want? Why thinking about effective learning environments is important is because most teachers currently inherit a teaching environment, usuallybased on a campus, physicalclassrooms, regularly scheduled lessons, with the expectation of the teacher in control at the front of the class. However, new technologiesprovideuswiththeopportunitytodesignotherkindsoflearningenvironments.Whatdo wewanttobe:coalminers–orgardeners?Orsomethingelse?Myownviewisthattheideallearning environmentissomewhereinbetweencoalminingandgardening.Mostlearnersrequirestructureand guidance, but within an environment that enables freedom and exploration. In developing an effective learning environment, there are another two issues that need to be addressed: • First, it is the learner who has to do the learning. • Second, any learning environment is much more than the technology used to support it. Withregardtothefirst,teacherscannotdothelearningforthelearner.Allteachersorinstructorscando istocreateandmanageanenvironmentthatenablesandencourageslearning.Myfocustheninterms ofbuildinganeffectivelearningenvironmentisonwhatthe teacherorinstructorcando,becauseinthe endthatisalltheycancontrol.However,thefocusofwhattheteacherdoesshouldbeonthelearner, andwhatthelearnerneeds.Thatofcoursewillrequiregoodcommunicationbetweenthelearnersand the teacher. Forthisreason,Iwanttoexaminesomeofthefundamentalcomponentsofmosteffectiveteaching environments. Not only will this provide some general guidance for the design of teaching, it will alsoallowconsiderationoftechnology-basedlearningenvironmentsthatcanfundamentallydifferfrom traditional campus-based environments, while at the same time ensuring conditions for successful learning. I set out these components or conditions in the following sections. 6.2 What is a learning environment? 6.2.1Definition ‘Learning environment refers to the diverse physical locations, contexts, and cultures in which students learn. Since students may learn in a wide variety of settings, such as outside-of-school locations and outdoor environments, the term is often used as a more accurate or preferred alternative to classroom, which has more limited and traditional connotations—a room with rows of desks and a chalkboard, for example. The term also encompasses the culture of a school or class—its presiding ethos and characteristics, 271 including how individuals interact with and treat one another—as well as the ways in which teachers may organize an educational setting to facilitate learning…..’ The Glossary of Educational Reform, 29 August, 2014 Thisdefinitionrecognisesthatstudentslearninmanydifferentwaysinverydifferentcontexts.Since learnersmustdothelearning,theaimis tocreateatotalenvironmentforlearningthatoptimisesthe ability of students to learn. There is of course no single optimum learning environment. There isan infinite number of possible learning environments, which is what makes teaching so interesting. 6.2.2 Types of learning environments Here are some examples of different learning environments: • a school or college campus • an online course • military training • friends, family and work • nature • personal, technology-based, learning environments Nevertheless I will argue that despite the differences in context, there are certain elements or components that will be foundin most effective learning environments. 6.2.3 Components of an effective learning environment Developing a total learning environment for students in a particular course or program is probably the most creative part of teaching. Although there is a tendencyto focus on either physicalinstitutionallearning environments (such as classrooms, lecture theatres and labs), or on the technologies used toto create online learning environments such as learning management systems, learning environments are broader than just these physical components.They will also include: • the characteristics of the learners and their means of inter-communication; • the goals for teaching and learning; • the activities that support learning; • the resources that are available, such as textbooks, technology, or learning spaces; • the assessment strategies that will best measure and drive learning; • the culture that infuses the learning environment. Figure 6.2.2 illustrates one possible learning environment from the perspective of a teacher or instructor.Ateachermayhavelittleornocontroloversomecomponents,suchaslearnercharacteristics or resources, but may have full control over other components such as choice of content and how learnerswillbesupported.Withineachofthemaincomponentsthereareasetofsub-componentsthat willneed tobeconsidered.Infact,itisinthesub-components(contentstructure,practicalactivities, feedback, use of technology, assessment methods, and so on) where the real decisions need to be made. IhavelistedjustafewcomponentsinFigure6.2.2andthesetisnotmeanttobecomprehensive.For instance it could have included other components, such asdeveloping ethical behaviour, institutional factors,orexternalaccreditation,eachofwhichmightalsoaffectthelearningenvironmentinwhicha teacherorinstructorhastowork.Creatingamodelofalearningenvironmentthenisaheuristicdevice that aims to provide a comprehensive view of the whole teaching context for a particular course or program,byaparticularinstructororteacherwithaparticularviewoflearning.Onceagain,thechoice ofcomponentsandtheirperceivedimportancewillbedriventosomeextentbypersonalepistemologies and beliefs about knowledge, learning and teaching methods. Lastly, I have deliberately suggested a learning environmentfrom the perspective of ateacher, as theteacherhasthemainresponsibilityforcreatinganappropriatelearningenvironment,butitisalso important to consider learning environments from the learners’ perspectives. Indeed, adult or mature learnersareoftencapableofcreatingtheirown,personal,relativelyautonomouslearningenvironments. Thesignificantpointisthatitisimportant toidentifythosecomponentsthatneed tobeconsidered in teaching a course or program. In particular that there are othercomponentsbesides content or curriculum. EachofthekeycomponentsofthelearningenvironmentIhavechosenasanexampleare discussedbrieflyinthefollowingsections,withafocusonthecomponentsofalearningenvironment that are particularly relevant for a digital age. 6.3 Learner characteristics Figure 6.3 Learner characteristics Probablynothingmorereflectsteachinginadigitalagethanthechangeinlearnercharacteristicsfrom the industrial age. 6.3.1 Increased diversity I noted inChapter 1 (Section6)that in developed countries such as Canada: public post-secondary institutions are expected to represent the same kind of socio-economic and cultural diversity as in society at large, rather than being institutions reserved for an elite minority. Inanagewhereeconomicdevelopmentistightlyassociatedwithhigherlevelsofeducation,thegoal now is to bring as many students as possible to the standards required, rather than focus on just the needs of the most able students. This means finding ways of helping a very wide range of students withverydifferentlevelsofabilityand/orpriorknowledgetosucceed.Onesizeclearlydoesnotfitall 275 today.Dealingwithanincreasinglydiversestudentpopulationisperhapsthegreatestofallchallenges thenthatteachersandinstructorsfaceinadigitalage,particularlybutnotexclusivelyatapost-secondary level.Thisisnotsomethingforwhichinstructorsprimarilyqualifiedinsubjectmatterexpertisearewell prepared. Acombination of good design and an appropriate use of technology will greatly facilitate the personalizationoflearning,allowingforinstancefordifferentstudentstoworkatdifferentspeeds,and tofocuslearningonstudents’specificinterestsandneeds,thusensuringengagementandmotivationfor adiverserangeofstudents.However,thefirstandperhapsmostimportantstepisforinstructorstoknow theirstudents,andinparticular, toidentifyfromthe vastrangeofinformationregardingstudentsand theirdifferences,whicharethemostimportantforthedesignofteachingandlearninginadigitalage.I list some of the characteristics that I think areimportant from the perspective of designing teaching. 6.3.2 The work and home context Twofactorsmaketheworkandhomecontextanimportantconsiderationinthedesignofteachingand learning:students areincreasinglyworkingwhilestudying(abouthalfofallCanadianpost-secondary students also work, and those that do workaverage 16 hours a week –Marshall, 2010); and the age rangeofstudentscontinuestospread,withtheaverageageofstudentsslowlyincreasing(in2016,atthe UniversityofBritishColumbiaVancouver,theaverageageofundergraduateswas21,andthemeanage for graduate students was31 –UBC,2017.) There are several reasons for the average age of students increasing, at least in North America: • students are taking longer to graduate (partly because they tend to takea smaller studyload when working); • increasing numbers of students are going on to graduate school; • more students are coming back for additional courses and programs after graduating (lifelong learners), mainly for economic reasons. Partlyorfullyemployedstudents,orstudentswithfamilies,increasinglyneedmoreflexibilityintheir studying, and especially avoiding long commutes between home, work and college. These students increasinglywanthybridorfullyonlinecourses,andsmallermodules,certificatesorprogramsthatthey can fit around their work and family life. 6.3.3 Learners’ goals Understandingthemotivationofstudentsandwhattheyexpecttogetoutofacourseorprogramshould alsoinfluencethedesignof acourseorprogram.Foracademiclearning,itisoftennecessary tofind waystomovestudentswhoseapproachtolearningisinitiallydrivenbyextrinsicrewardssuchasgrades orqualificationstoanapproachthatengagesandmotivatesstudentsinthesubjectmatteritself.Potential studentsalreadywithapost-secondaryqualificationandagoodjobmaynotwanttoworkthroughapre.determinedsetofcoursesbutmaywantjustspecificareasofcontentfromexistingcourses,tailoredto meettheirneeds(forinstance,ondemandanddeliveredonline).Thusitisimportanttohavesomekind ofknowledgeorunderstandingofwhylearnersarelikelytotakeyourcourseorprogram,andwhatthey are hoping to get out of it. 6.3.4Prior knowledge or skills Futurelearningoftendependsonstudentshavingpriorknowledgeoranabilitytodothingsatacertain level.

Prensky(2010)andothers(e.g.Tapscott, 2008) argue that not only are such studentsmore proficient in using such technologiesthan previous generations, but that they also think differently (Tapscott,2008). However,itisparticularlyimportanttounderstandthatstudentsthemselvesvaryagreatdealintheir useofsocialmediaandnewtechnologies,thattheiruseislargelydrivenbysocialandpersonaldemands, andtheiruseofdigitaltechnologiesdoesnotnaturallyflowacrossintoeducationaluse.Theywilluse newtechnologiesandsocialmediaforlearningthoughwhereinstructorsmake agoodcaseforitand whenstudentscanseethattheuseofdigitalmediawilldirectlyhelpthemintheirstudies.Forthisto happenthoughdeliberatedesignchoicesarerequiredonthepartoftheinstructor.(Formoreontheissue of digital natives, seeChapter 9, Section 2.3) 6.3.6In conclusion The work and home context, learners’ goals, and students’prior knowledge and skills (including their competence withdigitalmedia) aresomeofthecriticalfactorsthatshouldinfluencethedesign of teaching. For someinstructors, other characteristics of learners, such as learning styles, gender differences or cultural background, may be more important, depending on the context. Whatever the context,gooddesigninteachingrequiresgoodinformationaboutthelearnerswearegoingtoteach,and in particular good design needs to address the increasing diversity of our students. References Marshall, K.

I include within structure: • the selection and sequencing of content, • developing a particular focus or approach to specific content areas, • helping students with the analysis, interpretation or application of content • integrating and relating different content areas. Traditionally, content has been structured by breaking a course into a number of topic-related classesdelivered in a particular sequence, and within the classes, by instructors ‘framing’ and interpreting content. (You can see how this mirrors an industrial manufacturing process). However, newtechnologiesprovidealternativemeanstostructurecontent.Learningmanagementsystemssuchas BlackboardorMoodlestillenableinstructorstoselectandsequencecontentmaterial,butstudentscan accessthis–andother–contentanywhere,atanytime–andinanyorder.Theavailabilityofawide rangeofcontentovertheInternet,andtheabilitytocollectandsortcontentthroughblogs,wikis,and e-portfolios, enable students increasingly to impose their own structures on content. Students need some form of structure within content areas, partly because some things need to be learned in ‘the right order’, partly because without structure content becomes a jumble of unrelated topics,andpartlybecausestudentscan’t knoworworkoutwhatisimportantandwhatis notwithin atotalcontentdomain,atleastuntiltheyhavestartedstudyingit.Novicestudentsinparticularneed to know what they must study each week.

To answer this question will mean returning to the goals for learning content and the overall goals of the course: • if memorization is important, then automated tests such as computer-marked assignments with correct answers being provided can be used; • if the aim is to enable students to draw on content such as facts, principles, data or evidence to construct an argument, to solve equations, or to design an experiment, then opportunities for practising such skills will be needed; • if the aim is to help students to manage knowledge, then we may need to set tasks that require them to select, evaluate, analyse and apply content. Weshallseethattechnologyenablesustowidenconsiderablytherangeofactivitiesthatstudentscan usetomastercontent,buttheseneedtoberelatedtothelearninggoalssetforthecourseofprogram.

Learner support covers a wide range of functions, and is discussed throughout the book, but particularly in: • Chapter 3, Section 7 • Chapter 4, Section 4 • Chapter 9, Section 6 • Chapter 12, Section 10. Brindley et al. (2004) provide an extensive overview of the full range of activities in providing learner 289 support for online and distance education learners.Here though my focus is limited to indicating why it is an essential element of an effective learning environment, and to describe briefly some of the main sub-components of learner support. 6.6.2Scaffolding Figure 6.6.2 Learner support I use the term scaffolding to cover the many functions in diagnosing and responding to learners’ difficulties, including: • helping students when they struggle with new concepts or ideas; • helping students to gain a deeper understanding of a topic or subject; • helping students to evaluate a range of different ideas or practices; • helping students to understand the limits of knowledge; • above all challenging students to go beyond their current level of thinking or practiceto acquire deeper understanding or a higher level of competency. These activities normally take the form ofpersonal interventions and communication between an instructorand anindividualoragroupofstudents,inface-to-face contextsoronline.Theseactivities tendnottobepre-planned,requiringagooddealofspontaneityandresponsivenessonthepartofthe teacher or instructor. However, more recently there have been examples of automated learner support, such as virtual assistantsorchatbots(forareviewofresearchonchatbotsineducation,seeWinklerandSöllner,2018). Alsolearninganalyticshavebeenused todetermineastudent’s performanceandwherenecessary to direct them to further readings or work (see for instance, Vesin et al.,2018). Scaffoldingisusuallyameansofindividualisingthelearning,enablingstudentdifferencesinlearning to be better accommodated as they occur. 6.6.3 Feedback This could be seen as a sub-category of scaffolding, but it covers the role of providingfeedback on studentperformanceofactivitiessuchaswritingassignments,projectwork,creativeactivities,andother studentactivitiesbeyondthecurrentandperhapsfuturescopeofautomatedcomputerfeedback.Again, theinstructor’srolehereistoprovidemoreindividualisationoffeedbacktodealwithmorequalitatively assessedstudent activities, and may or may not be associated with formal assessment or grading. 6.6.4Counselling As well as direct support within their academic studying, learnersoften need help and guidance on administrativeorpersonalissues,suchasfinancialdifficulties,orwhethertorepeatacourse,delayan assignmentbecauseofsicknessinthefamily,orcancelenrollmentinacourseandpostponeittoanother date.Althoughsuchservicesmaybeavailableoutsidetheprovisionofaparticularcourse,thispotential sourceofhelpneedstobeconsideredinthedesignofaneffectivelearningenvironment,withtheaim ofdoingallthatcanbedonetoensurethatstudentscanmanageexternalpressureswhilemeetingthe academic standards of a program. 6.6.5Other students Otherstudentscanbeagreatsupportforlearners.Muchofthiswillhappeninformally,throughstudents talkingafterclass,throughsocialmedia,orhelpingeachotherwithassignments.However,instructors canmakemoreformaluseofotherstudentsbydesigningcollaborativelearningactivities,groupwork, and designing online discussions so that students need to work together rather than individually. 6.6.6 Why learner support is so important We shall see inChapter 12 that gooddesign can substantially reducedemandforlearner support, by ensuringclarityandbybuildinginappropriatelearningactivities.Studentsalsovaryenormouslyintheir needforsupportinlearning.Manylifelonglearners,whohavealreadybeenthroughapost-secondary education,havefamilies,careersandagreatdealoflifeexperience,canbeself-managed,autonomous learners,identifyingwhattheyneed tolearnandhowbest todothis.Attheotherextreme,there are studentsforwhomtheformalschoolsystemwasadisaster,wholackbasiclearningskillsorfoundations, suchasreading,writingandmathematicalskills,andthereforelackconfidenceinlearning.Thesewill need a lot of support to succeed. However the vast majority of learners are somewhere in the middle of the spectrum, occasionally runningintoproblems, unsurewhatstandards areexpected,andneeding toknowhowthey aredoing in their studying. Indeed, there is a good deal of research that indicates that ‘instructor presence’ is associatedwithstudentsuccessorfailureinacourse,atleastinonlinelearning(see,forinstance,Shea etal.,2010).Wherestudentsfeeltheinstructorisnotpresent,bothlearnerperformanceandcompletion rates decline. For such students, good, timely learner support isthe difference between success and failure. Itshouldbenotedthattheneedforgoodlearnersupport,andtheabilitytoprovideit,isnotdependent onthemediumofinstruction.Thekindofcreditonlinecoursesthathavebeendesignedanddelivered longbeforeMOOCscamealongoftenprovidedhighlevelsoflearnersupport,throughhavingastrong instructor presence and careful design to ensure students were supported. Atthesametime,althoughcomputerprogramscangosomewaytoprovidinglearnersupport,many ofthe mostimportantfunctionsoflearnersupportassociatedwithhigh-levelconceptuallearningand skillsdevelopmentstillneedtobeprovidedbyanexpertteacherorinstructor,whetherpresentorata distance. Furthermore, this kind oflearner supportis difficult to scale up, as it tends to be relatively labourintensiveandrequiresinstructorswithadeeplevelofknowledgewithinthesubjectarea.Thus, theneedtoprovideadequatelevelsoflearnersupportcannotjustbewishedaway,ifwearetoachieve successful learning on a large scale. Thismayseemobvioustoteachers,buttheimportanceoflearnersupportforstudentsuccessisnot alwaysrecognisedorappreciated,ascanbeseenfromthedesignofmanyMOOCs,andthereactionof politiciansandthemediatothecostsavingspromisedbythekindofMOOCsthatfocusoneliminating learnersupport.Therearealsodifferentattitudesfrominstructorsandinstitutionstowardstheneedfor learnersupport.Somefacultymaybelievethat‘It’smyjobtoinstructandyourstolearn’;inotherwords, oncestudentsarepresentedwiththenecessarycontentthroughlecturesorreading,therestisuptothem. Nevertheless,therealityisthatinanysystemwithawidediversityofstudents,asissocommontoday, effectivelearner support is essential for student success. References Brindley, J.,Walti,C.andZawacki-Richter, O.(eds.)(2004)Learner Support in Open, Distance and Online Learning Environments Oldenburg, Germany: Biblioteks-und informationssystem der Universität Oldenburg Shea, P. et al.

Adjunct or sessional instructors, teaching assistants, librarians, faculty development workshops, and technical supportstaff,includinginstructionaldesigners,mediaproducersandITtechnicalsupportareallforms of teaching assistance. Itisimportanttothinkaboutthebestwaytousesupportingstaff.Inuniversities,thetendencyisto chopalargeclassintosections,witheachsectionwithitsownsessionalinstructororteachingassistant, whichthenoperaterelativelyindependently,withoftenlargedifferencesinthequalityoftheteaching in different sections, depending on the ability of the teaching assistants. However, new technologies enablethe teaching to be organised differently and more consistently. Forinstance, aseniorprofessormaydeterminetheoverallcurriculumand assessmentstrategy,and workingwithaninstructionaldesigner,providetheoveralldesignofacourse.Sessionalsand/orteaching assistantsthenarehiredtodeliverthecourseeitherface-to-faceoronlineormoreoftenamixofboth, underthesupervisionoftheseniorprofessor(seetheNationalCenterforAcademicTransformationfor examples).Flippedclassroomsareanotherwaytoorganiseresourcesdifferently(seeBlendedLearning in Introductory Psychologyas an example.) One model is for the senior professor to record lectures whichstudentsviewintheirowntime,thenforstudentstomeetinsub-groupswithateachingassistant or assistants to clarify concepts, discuss topics, or other class activities. These sub-groups may meet either face-to-face or online. There are also opportunities to increase resources through the use of technology. Online learning maybringinmorenewstudents(forinstancefromoutsidethenormalcatchmentarea)andhencemore revenuesthroughgovernmentgrantsfortheextrastudentsand/ordirecttuitionrevenue,sotheremaybe economiesofscalewhichwouldenabletheinstitutiontohiremorecorefacultyorsessionalsfromthe extra revenues generated by the additional online students. Indeed, there are now examples of fully online masters’ programs more than covering their full cost,includingthehiringofresearchprofessorstoteachtheprogram,fromtuitionrevenuesalone(the UniversityofBritishColumbia’sonlineMasterinEducationalTechnologyisoneexample,eventhough itstuitionfeesarethesameasthoseformasters’programsofferedoncampus–seeBatesandSangra, 2011). Thusresources(orthelackofthem)canhaveaprofoundinfluenceontheeffectivenessofalearning environment. 6.7.2Facilities Physical facilities available to an instructor and students include classrooms, labs, and the library. These are the more traditional components of a learning environment. However, physical facilities also can constrain the design of learning, because for examplethe physical set-up of a lecture hall or classroom may limit opportunities for discussion or project work, or an instructor may be forced to organise the teaching aroundthreehoursof lecturing and six hours oflabs perweek, to ‘fit’ with broader institutional requirements for classroom allocations (seeHow Online Learning is Going to Affect Classroom Designregarding attempts to re-design classrooms for the digital age.) Onlinelearningcanfreeinstructorsandstudentsfromsuchrigidphysicalconstraints,butthereisstill aneedforstructureandorganizationofunitsormodulesofteaching,evenorespeciallywhenteaching online.ForinstancelearningmanagementsystemssuchasBlackboardorMoodleprovideastructured online environment, but they too come with their own constraints. 6.7.3 Technology Classroom technology such as whiteboards, projectors and computers for presentation are traditional technology support. I would also include textbooks here because we will see in Chapter 8 that they are a form of technology. However, the development of new technologies, and especially learning management systems, lecture capture, video streaming, and social media, have radical implications for the design of teaching and learning. This isdiscussed in much more depthin Chapters 7, 8 and 9, but for the purpose of describing an effectivelearning environment, the technologies available to aninstructorcancontributeimmenselytocreatinginteractiveandengaginglearningenvironmentsfor students. However, it is important to emphasise that technology is just one component within any effective learning environment, and needs to be balanced and integrated with all the other components. 6.7.4The instructor’s time Thisisthegreatestandmostpreciousresourceofall!Buildinganeffectivelearningenvironmentisan iterativeprocess,butintheend,theteachingdesign,andtosomeextentthelearningenvironmentasa whole,willbedependentonthetimeavailablefromtheinstructor(andhisorherteam)forteaching.The lesstimeavailable,themorerestrictivethelearningenvironmentislikelytobe,unlesstheinstructor’s timeisverycarefullymanaged.Again,though,gooddesigntakesinto accountthetimeavailablefor teaching (seeChapter 12, Section 9in particular). 6.7.5Resources, class size and control Nothing drives an instructor to distraction more than trying to manage withinadequate resources. Certainly, ifateacherorinstructorisallocated aclassof200students,ina largelecturehall,with no additionalteachingsupport,thentheinstructorisgoingtohavedifficultycreating arichandeffective learningenvironment,becausethelackofresourceslimitstheoptions.Ontheotherhand,aninstructor with 30 students, access to a wide range of technology, freedom to organise and structure the curriculum,and with support from an instructional designer and a web designer, has the luxury ofexploringa range of different designs and possible learning environments. Neverthelessitisprobablywhenresourcesaremostscarcethatthemostcreativityisneededtobreak outoftraditional teaching models.Newtechnology, ifproperlyused andavailable,doesenable even largeclasseswithotherwisefewresourcestobedesignedwitharelativelyrichlearningenvironment. This is discussedin more detail inChapter 13, Section 5. At the same time, expectations need to be realistic.Providingadequatelearnersupportwithaninstructor:studentratioof1:200ormorewillalways beachallenge.Improvementsarepossiblethroughre-design–butnotmiracles.(Formoreonincreasing productivity through online teaching, seeProductivity and Online Learning Redux.) Bates, A. and Sangrà, A. (2011) Managing Technology in Higher Education: Strategies for Transforming Teaching and Learning San Francisco: Jossey Bass 1. Are there other resources that influence the design of an effective learning environment that I should have included? 2. Winston Churchill once said ‘We shape our buildings and in turn our buildings shape us.’ To what extent do you think online learning can free us of some of the constraints that buildings impose on the design of teaching and learning? What new constraints does online learning bring in terms of design? 3. How do you feel about the whole issue of teaching assistance? I have grave reservations myself about the use of students as teaching assistants in universities, in terms of the quality of the teaching (not so much the principle, but the practice.). I also believe that sessionals and adjunct instructors are badly treated in terms of how they are managed.In British Columbia we have had two Supreme Court cases andamajor teachers’ strike over class size and composition in schools, and in particular how much help school teachers should receive for coping with students with learning disabilities. But by bringing in less qualified (and cheaper) support for instructors, do we strengthen or weaken thelearning environment for students? No podcast from me – this activity is for your personal reflection – my views are stated above. 6.8Assessment of learning Figure 6.8.1 Assessment ‘I was struck by the way assessment always came at the end, not only in the unit of work but also in teachers’ planning….Assessment was almost an afterthought… Teachers…are being caught between competing purposes of …assessment and are often confused and frustrated by the difficulties that they experience as they try to reconcile the demands.’ Earle,2003 6.8.1 Learner assessment in a digital age Because assessment is a huge topic, it is important to be clear that the purpose of this section is: (a) to look at one of the components that constitute an effective and comprehensive learning environment, and; (b)briefly to examine the extent to which assessment is or should be changing in a digital age. Assessment again is discussed throughout the book, but particularly in: • Scenario C • Chapter 5, Section 4.6 • Chapter 8.7 c 299 • Chapter 11, Section 4.3 • Chapter 12, Section 11. However,assessmentrequiresasectiononitsown.Probablynothingdrivesthebehaviourofstudents morethanhowtheywillbeassessed.Notallstudentsareinstrumentalintheirlearning,butgiventhe competing pressures onstudents’time in adigitalage, most‘successful’learnersfocus onwhatwill be examined and how they can most effectively meet the assessment requirements (which for most studentsmeansinaslittletime aspossible).Thereforedecisionsaboutmethodsof assessmentwillin most contexts be fundamental to building an effective learning environment. 6.8.2The purpose of assessment There aremanydifferent reasons forassessinglearners.Itisimportant tobeclearabout thepurpose oftheassessment,becauseitisunlikelythatonesingleassessmentinstrumentwillmeetallassessment needs. Here are some reasons (you can probably think of many more): • to improve and extend students’ learning; • to assess students’ knowledge and competence in terms of desired learning goals or outcomes; • to provide the teacher/instructor with feedback on the effectiveness of their teaching and how it might be improved; • to provide information for employers about what the student knows and/or can do; • tofilter students forfurther study, jobs or professional advancement; • for institutional accountability and/or financial purposes. Ileaveit toyoutodecidetheorderofimportanceofthese reasonsforcreating aneffectivelearning environment. 6.8.3 Methodsof assessment The form the assessment takes, as well as the purpose, will be influenced by the instructors’ or examiners’ underlying epistemology: what they believe constitutes knowledge, and therefore how students need to demonstrate their knowledge. The form of assessment should also be influenced by the knowledge and skills that students need in a digital age, which means focusing as much on assessingskillsasonassessingknowledgeofcontent.Thuscontinuousorformativeassessmentwillbe as importanta considerationas summative or ‘end-of-course’ assessment. Thereis awiderangeofpossible assessmentmethods.Ihaveselected just afewtoillustratehow technology can change the way we assess learners in ways that are relevant to a digital age: 6.8.3.1No assessment Aquestion to be considered is whether there is aneed for assessment of learning in the first place.

Lastly, students themselves can extend their learning by participating in both self.assessmentandpeerassessment,preferablywithguidanceandmonitoringfromamoreknowledgeable or skilled instructor. 6.8.3.2Computer-based multiple-choice tests Thismethodisgoodfortesting‘objective’knowledgeoffacts,ideas,principles,laws,andquantitative proceduresinmathematics,scienceandengineeringetc.,andiscost-effectiveforthesepurposes.This formoftestingthoughtendstobelimitedforassessinghigher-levelintellectualskills,suchascomplex problem-solving, creativity, and evaluation, and therefore less likely to be useful for developing or assessing many of the skills needed in a digital age. 6.8.3.3 Written essays or short answers This method isgood for assessingcomprehension and some of the more advanced intellectual skills, such as critical thinking, but itislabour intensive, open to subjectivity, and not good for assessing practical skills. Experiments are taking place with automated essay marking, using developments in artificial intelligence, but so far automated essay marking still struggles toidentify validsemantic meaning, especially ata higher education level. For more discussion ofautomated essaymarking, see Chapter 8.7c.4.4 6.8.3.4 Peer assessment Thisisaverylargeandspecialisedtopic,whichItouchedoninChapter5,Section4.6.2.Therearethree main advantages of peer assessment: • if conducted properly, it can be an excellent pedagogical benefit to student learning as it requires students to think critically about what they have learned in order to judge other students’ work. It enables them to see other students’ perspectives on the concepts and ideas, thus widening and deepening their understanding; • it enables learner support to be scaled up, allowing instructors to handle larger numbers of students; • it develops a core 21st century skill of peer evaluation that will be critical when working in a digital society. However,ifnotdoneproperly,peerassessmentcanhavedisastrousconsequences.Iamnotaspecialist inthisareabutIhaveusedpeerassessmentinonlinelearning,butonlyatagraduatelevel.Theseare some of the lessons I learned: • There must be an intrinsic benefit to students doing the assessment. They must see how this will be useful to their own learning. • The instructor must give clear criteria or rubrics for assessment, preferably with examples of good or poor answers. • Students should be rewarded either with marks or praise by the instructor for excellent peer reviews. • Students must know that the instructor will not only monitor the peer assessments but also will take responsibility for final decisions on student-awarded grades or marks and will over.rule poor assessments by students. • Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. It is wise to have a parallel or independent method of assessment, such as multiple-choice tests or having half the total course assessment done in more traditional ways. Thusthere arebestpracticesthat mustbefollowed.Anyoneintending tousepeerassessmentshould prepare themselves properly by looking carefully into the literature. Macdonald (2015) or Topping (2018) offer guides for teachers. For an example of the successful use of peer assessment at a post.secondarylevel,seePeerEvaluationasaLearningandAssessmentStrategyattheSchoolofBusiness at Simon Fraser University 6.8.3.5Project work Project work encourages the development of authentic skills that require understanding of content, knowledge management, problem-solving, collaborative learning, evaluation, creativity and practical outcomes.Designingvalidandpracticalprojectworkneedsahighlevelofskillandimaginationfrom theinstructor, andthe assessmentprocesscanbelabour-intensive,butprojectworkis oneofthebest ways to assess the high level skills needed in a digital age. ‘Assessingstudentprojectwork‘byMelindaKolk onTheCreativeEducatorwebsiteprovides an excellent guideline on assessing studentprojectwork.Althoughintended fork-12 teachers,itisalso very appropriate for post-secondary educators. 6.8.3.6 e-Portfolios(an online compendium of student work) E-portfolios enable self-assessment through reflection, knowledge management, recordingand evaluationoflearningactivities,suchasteachingornursingpractice,andrecordingofanindividual’s contribution to project work (as an example, see the use of e-portfolios in Visual Arts and Built EnvironmentattheUniversityofWindsor.);e-portfoliosareusuallyself-managedbythelearnerbutcan be made available or adapted for formal assessment purposes or job interviews. 6.8.3.7 Simulations, educational games (usually online)and virtual worlds These enable thepractice and evaluation of skills, such as: • complex and real time decision-making, • operation of (simulated or remote) complex equipment, • the development of safety procedures and awareness, • risk taking and decision-makingin a safe environment, activities that require acombination of manual and cognitive skills (seethe training of Canadian Border Service officers at Loyalist College, Ontario). Figure 6.8.2 Virtual world border crossing, Loyalist College, Ontario Simulations and serious or educational games (discussed more extensively in Chapter 13) are currently expensive to develop, but cost-effective with multiple use, where theyreplace the use of extremely expensive equipment, where operational activities cannot be halted for training purposes, orwhereavailable asopeneducational resources.Becausestudents’actionsanddecision-making are recorded, authentic assessment is embedded in the process. 6.8.4In conclusion Nothing is likely to drive student learning more than the method of assessment.

In most learning environments, culture is often taken for granted or may be even beyond the consciousness of learners or even teachers. I will try to show why faculty, instructors and teachers should pay special attention to cultural factors, so that they can make conscious decisions about how the different components of a learning environment are implemented. Although the concept of culture may seem a little abstract at this stage, I will show how critical it is for designing an effective online learning environment, 6.9.2Defining culture I define culture as the dominant values and beliefs that influence decision-making. Thechoice ofcontent,the skills andattitudes that arepromoted,therelationshipbetweeninstructors andstudents,andmanyotheraspectsof alearningenvironment,willallbedeeplyinfluencedbythe 305 prevailingcultureofaninstitutionorclass(usedtomeananygroupingofstudentsandateacher).Thus inalearningenvironment,everyoneofthecomponentsIdescribedwillbeinfluencedbythedominant culture. Forinstance,parentstendtoplacetheirchildreninschoolsthatreflecttheirownsvaluesandbeliefs, andsothecharacteristicsoflearnersinthatschoolwillalsooftenbeinfluencedbytheculturenotonly oftheirparentsbutalsooftheirschool.Thisisoneofthemanywaysthatculturecanbeself-reinforcing. 6.9.3Identifying cultures Ifirstnoticedtheimpactofdifferentculturesmanyyearsago,whenIwasdoingresearchintheU.K. ontheadministrationoflargecomprehensive(high)schools.Giventhattheseschoolshaddeliberately beencreatedbyaleft-of-centregovernmentinBritaininthe1960stoprovideequalaccesstosecondary education for all, and that these schools had many things in common (their large size – often with 1,500 students or more, theircurricula, the idea that every student should havethe same educational opportunities) one would have expected that they all would have had a similar prevailing culture. However,Ivisitedover50suchschoolstocollectinformationonthehowtheyweremanagedandthe key issues they faced, and every one was different. Somewerecreatedfromformerlyhighlyselectivegrammarschools,andoperatedonastrictsystem ofsortingstudentsbytests,sothateachyearsuccessfulstudentswouldgoupalevelandthe‘weakest’ students would drop down a level, in order to identify the best prospects for university.

Here the dominant value was on developing ‘ladylike qualities’. Others were inner city schools, where the focus was often on bringing the best out of each child, whatever their abilities. In such schools, each class would contain children with as wide a range of abilitiesaspossible,buttheywereoftenrowdy,raucousplacesincomparisontothemoreelite-oriented institutions. Here the emphasis was on inclusiveness and equal opportunity. The differing cultures of each of these schools was so strong I could sometimes detect it just by walkinginthedoor,bythewaystudentsreactedwithstaffandeachotherinthecorridors,orevenby the way the students walked (or ran). 6.9.4 Culture and learning environments Whetheryouconsiderculturetobeagoodorbadinfluenceinalearningenvironmentwilldependon whether you share or reject the underlying values and beliefs of the dominant culture. ResidentialschoolsinCanadaintowhichaboriginalchildrenwereoftenforciblyplacedareaprime example of how culture drives the way schools operate.

What matters more is how technologies are applied. The same technology can be applied in different ways, even or especially in education. So in judging the value of a technology, we need to look more closely at the ways in which it is being or could be used. In essence this means focusing more on media – which represent the more holistic use of technologies – than on individualtools or technologies themselves, while still recognising that technology is an essential component of almost all media. 2. By focusing on media rather than technologies, we can then include face-to-face teaching as a medium, enabling comparisons with more technology-based media to be made along a number of dimensions or characteristics. 3. Recognising that in education media are usually used in combination, the sixkey building blocks of media are: 1. face-to-face teaching 2. text 3. (still) graphics 4. audio (including speech) 5. video 6. computing (including animation, simulations and virtual reality). 4. Mediadifferin terms of their formats, symbols systems, and cultural values. These unique features are increasingly referred to as the affordances of media or technology.Thus different media can be used to assist learners to learn in different ways and achieve different outcomes, thus also individualising learning more. 5. There are many dimensions along which some technologies are similar and others are different. By focusing on these dimensions, we have a basis for analysing new media and technologies, to see where they ‘fit’ within the existing landscape, and to evaluatetheir potential benefits or limitations for teaching and learning. 6. There are probably other characteristics or dimensions of educational media that might also be identified, but threekey characteristics or dimensions are particularlyimportant: . broadcast vs communicative . synchronous (live) vs asynchronous (recorded) . single vs rich media 7. However, the identification of where a particular medium fits along any specific characteristic or dimension will depend in most cases on how that medium is designed. On the other hand, there is usually a limit to how far a technology can be forced along one of these dimensions; there is likely to be a single, ‘natural’ position on each dimension, subject to good design, in terms of exploiting the educational affordances of the medium. 8. These characteristics or dimensions of media then need to be evaluated against the learning goals and outcomes desired, while recognising that a new educational medium or application mightenable goals to be achieved that had not been previously considered possible. 9. Over time, mediahave tended to become more communicative, asynchronous, and ‘rich’, thus offering teachers and learners more powerful tools for teaching and learning. 10. The Internet is an extremely powerful medium because through a combination of tools and media it can encompass all the characteristics and dimensions of educational media. 7.1Choosing technologies for teaching and learning: the challenge Figure 7.1 How many technologies can you identify in this home entertainment system?

On the technical side, it is becoming increasingly difficult to classify or categorizetechnologies, notjustbecausethey arechangingsoquickly, butalsobecausetechnologies havemanydifferentqualitiesandaffordancesthatchangeaccordingtothecontextsinwhichtheyare used.Onthepragmaticside,itwouldbeamistaketofocussolelyonthepedagogicalcharacteristicsof technologies. There are social, organizational, cost and accessibility issues also to be considered. The selection and use of technologies for teaching and learning is driven as much by context and values and beliefs as by hard scientific evidence or rigorous theory. So there will not be one ‘best’ frameworkormodel.Ontheotherhand,giventherapidlyescalatingrangeoftechnologies,educators are increasingly caught between technological determinism (inappropriate applications of artificial intelligence,forinstance)orthetotalrejectionoftechnologyforteachingbecauseitissocomplex.Thus we need some models to guide their selection and use. We shallalso seethoughthat evenwithsuchmodels orframeworksfordecision-making,thereare in fact still some fundamental, unanswered questions regarding the use of technology for teaching, including: • what is best done face-to-face and what online, and in what contexts? • what is the role of the human teacher, and can/should/will the human teacherbe replaced by technology? Nevertheless,ifweconsiderateacherfacingagroupofstudentsandacurriculumtoteach,oralearner seeking to develop their own learning, there is need for practical guidance now about when to use onetechnologyoranother.InthisandthenexttwochaptersIwillprovidesometheoreticalmodelsor frameworks that will enable such questions to be answered effectively and pragmatically so that the learning experience is optimized. Inthemeantimelet’s startwithwhatyourviews areatthemomentaboutchoosingtechnologyfor teaching and learning. 1.How do you decide at the moment about what technologies to use for teaching? • Use what’s in the room? • Ask the IT support people? • Use a theory or set of principles for making such a decision?

Are the tablets of stone an educational technology? (See Selwood, 2014, for a discussion of the possible language of the Ten Commandments) Image: Allstar/Cinetext/Paramount Arguments about the role of technology in education go back at least 2,500 years. To understand better the role and influence of technology on teaching, we need a little history, because as always there arelessonsto belearned from history. Paul Saettler’s ‘The Evolution ofAmerican Educational Technology‘(1990)isoneofthemostextensivehistoricalaccounts,butonlygoesupto1989.Alothas happenedsincethen.WhatI’mgivingyouhereisthepostagestampversionofedtechhistory,anda personal one at that. 7.2.1 Oral communication Oneoftheearliest meansofformalteaching wasoral–throughhumanspeech –althoughovertime, technologyhasbeenincreasinglyusedtofacilitateor‘back-up’oralcommunication.Inancienttimes, stories, folklore, histories and news were transmitted and maintained through oral communication, 321 makingaccuratememorizationacriticalskill,andtheoraltraditionisstillthecaseinmanyaboriginal cultures.FortheancientGreeks,oratoryandspeechwerethemeansbywhichpeoplelearnedandpassed onlearning.Homer’sIliadandtheOdysseywererecitativepoems,intendedforpublicperformance.To belearned, theyhad tobememorizedbylistening, notbyreading,andtransmitted byrecitation, not bywriting.LecturesgobackatleastasfarastheancientGreeks.Demosthenes(384-322BC)wasan outstanding orator whose speeches influenced the politics of Athens. Nevertheless,bythefifthcenturyB.C,writtendocumentsexistedinconsiderablenumbersinancient Greece.IfwebelievePlato,educationhasbeenonadownwardspiral eversince.AccordingtoPlato, Socratescaughtoneofhisstudents(Phaedrus)pretendingtoreciteaspeechfrommemorythatinfacthe hadlearnedfromawrittenversion.SocratesthentoldPhaedrusthestoryofhowthegodTheuthoffered theKingofEgyptthegiftofwriting,whichwouldbea‘recipeforbothmemoryandwisdom’.Theking was not impressed. According to the king: it [writing] will implant forgetfulness in their souls; they will cease to exercise memory because they will rely on what is written, creating memory not from within themselves, but by means of external symbols. What you have discovered is a recipe not for memory, but for reminding. And it is no true wisdom that you offer your disciples, but only its semblance, for by telling them many things without teaching them anything, you will make them seem to know much, while for the most part they will know nothing. And as men filled not with wisdom but the conceit of wisdom, they will be a burden to their fellow men. Phaedrus, 274c-275, translation adapted from Manguel,1996 I can just hear some of my former colleagues saying the same thing about social media. SlateboardswereinuseinIndiainthe12thcenturyAD,andblackboards/chalkboardsbecameused inschoolsaroundtheturnofthe18thcentury.AttheendofWorldWarTwotheU.S.Armystartedusing overheadprojectorsfortraining,andtheirusebecamecommonforlecturing,untilbeinglargelyreplaced byelectronicprojectorsandpresentationalsoftwaresuchasPowerpointaround1990.Thismaybethe placetopointoutthatmosttechnologiesusedineducationwerenotdevelopedspecificallyforeducation but for other purposes (mainly for the military or business.) Although the telephone dates from the late 1870s, the standard telephone system never became a majoreducationaltool,notevenindistanceeducation,becauseofthehighcostofanaloguetelephone callsformultipleusers,althoughaudio-conferencinghasbeenusedtosupplementothermediasincethe 1970s.

Webinars now are used largely for delivering lectures over the Internet. None of these technologies though changes the oral basis of communication for teaching. 7.2.2 Writtencommunication The role of text or writingin education also has a long history. According to the Bible, Moses used chiseledstonetoconveythetencommandmentsinaformofwriting,probablyaroundthe7thcentury BC. Even though Socratesis reported to haverailed against the use of writing, written forms of communication make analytic, lengthy chains of reasoning and argument much more accessible, reproduciblewithoutdistortion,andthusmoreopentoanalysisandcritiquethanthetransientnatureof speech. TheinventionoftheprintingpressinEuropeinthe15thcenturywasatrulydisruptivetechnology, making written knowledge much more freely available, very much in the same way as the Internet has done today. As a result of the explosion of written documents resulting from the mechanization of printing, many more people in government and business were required to become literate and analytical,whichledtoarapidexpansionofformaleducationinEurope.Thereweremanyreasonsfor thedevelopmentoftheRenaissanceandtheEnlightenment,andthetriumphofreasonandscienceover superstition and beliefs in Europe, but the technology of printing was a key agent of change. Improvementsintransportinfrastructureinthe19thcentury,andinparticularthecreationofacheap and reliable postal system in the 1840s, led to the development of the first formal correspondence education,withtheUniversityofLondonofferinganexternaldegreeprogrambycorrespondencefrom 1858.ThisfirstformaldistancedegreeprogramstillexiststodayintheformoftheUniversityofLondon Worldwide.Inthe1970s,theOpenUniversitytransformedtheuseofprintforteachingthroughspecially designed,highlyillustratedprintedcourseunitsthatintegratedlearningactivitieswiththeprintmedium, based on advanced instructional design. With the development of web-based learning management systems in the mid-1990s, textual communication,althoughdigitized,became,atleastforabrieftime,themaincommunicationmedium for Internet-based learning, although lecture capture andvideo streamingis now changing that. 7.2.3Broadcasting and video Figure 7.2.3 BBC television studio and radio transmitter, Alexandra Palace, London Image: © Copyright Oxyman and licensed for reuse under a Creative Commons Licence The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) began broadcasting educational radio programs for schools in the 1920s. The first adult education radio broadcast from the BBC in 1924 was a talk on Insects in Relation to Man, andinthesameyear,J.C.Stobart,thenewDirectorofEducationattheBBC, musedabout‘abroadcastinguniversity’inthejournalRadioTimes(Robinson,1982).Television was firstusedineducationinthe1960s,forschoolsandforgeneraladulteducation(oneofthesixpurposes in the current BBC’s Royal Charter is still‘promoting education and learning’). In1969,theBritishgovernmentestablishedtheOpenUniversity(OU),whichworkedinpartnership with the BBC to develop university programs open to all, using a combination originally of printed materials specially designed by OU staff, and television and radio programs made by the BBC but integrated with the courses. Although the radio programs involved mainly oral communication, the televisionprogramsdidnotuselecturesassuch,butfocusedmoreonthecommonformatsofgeneral television,suchasdocumentaries,demonstrationofprocesses,andcases/casestudies(seeBates,1984). Inotherwords,theBBCfocusedontheunique‘affordances’oftelevision,atopicthatwillbediscussed in much more detail later. Over time, as new technologies such as audio-and video-cassettes were introduced,livebroadcasting,especiallyradio,wascutbackforOUprograms,althoughtherearestill somegeneraleducationalchannelsbroadcastingaroundtheworld(e.g.TVOntarioinCanada;PBS,the History Channel, and the Discovery Channel in the USA). Theuseoftelevisionforeducationquicklyspreadaroundtheworld,beingseeninthe1970sbysome, particularlyininternationalagenciessuchastheWorldBankandUNESCO,asapanaceaforeducation indevelopingcountries,thehopesforwhichquicklyfadedwhentherealitiesoflackofelectricity,cost, security of publicly available equipment, climate, resistance from local teachers, and local language andculturalissuesbecameapparent(see,forinstance,JamisonandKlees,1973).Satellitebroadcasting started to become available in the 1980s, and similar hopes were expressed of delivering ‘university lecturesfromtheworld’sleadinguniversitiestotheworld’sstarvingmasses’,butthesehopestooquickly fadedforsimilarreasons.However,India,whichhadlauncheditsownsatellite,INSAT,in1983,used it initially for delivering locally produced educational television programs throughout the country, in severalindigenouslanguages,usingIndian-designedreceiversandtelevision setsinlocalcommunity centres as well as schools (Bates,1984). In the 1990s the cost of creating and distributing video dropped dramatically due to digital compressionandhigh-speedInternet access. Thisreductioninthecosts ofrecordinganddistributing videoalsoled tothedevelopmentoflecturecapturesystems.Thetechnologyallowsstudents toview or review lectures at any time and place with an Internet connection. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) started making its recorded lectures available to the public, free of charge, via its OpenCourseWare project, in 2002. YouTube started in 2005 and was bought by Google in 2006.

In the late 1970s, Murray Turoff and Roxanne Hiltz at the New Jersey Institute of Technology were experimenting with blended learning, using NJIT’s internal computer network. Theycombined classroom teaching withonlinediscussionforums,andtermedthis‘computer-mediatedcommunication’orCMC(Hiltzand Turoff, 1978). At the University of Guelph in Canada, an off-the-shelf software system called CoSy wasdevelopedinthe1980sthatallowedforonlinethreadedgroupdiscussionforums,apredecessorto today’sforumscontainedinlearningmanagementsystems.In1988,theOpenUniversityintheUnited Kingdomofferedacourse,DT200,thataswellastheOU’straditionalmediaofprintedtexts,television programs and audio-cassettes, also included an online discussion component using CoSy.

The courses were open to anyone and had no formal assessment. In 2012, twoStanfordUniversityprofessorslaunched alecture-capturebasedMOOC onartificialintelligence, attractingmorethan100,000students,andsincethenMOOCshaveexpandedrapidlyaroundtheworld. 7.2.5Social media Socialmediaarereallyasub-categoryofcomputertechnology,buttheirdevelopmentdeservesasection of its own in the history of educational technology. Social media cover a wide range of different technologies, including blogs, wikis, You Tube videos, mobile devices such as phones and tablets, Twitter, Skype and Facebook. Andreas Kaplan and Michael Haenlein (2010) define social media as a group of Internet-based applications that …allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content, based on interactions among people in which they create, share or exchange information and ideas in virtual communities and networks. Socialmediaarestronglyassociatedwithyoungpeopleand‘millenials’–inotherwords,manyofthe studentsinpost-secondaryeducation.Atthetimeofwritingsocialmediaareonlyjustbeingintegrated intoformaleducation,andtodatetheirmaineducationalvaluehasbeeninnon-formaleducation,such asfosteringonlinecommunitiesofpractice,oraroundtheedgesofclassroomteaching,suchas‘tweets’ duringlecturesorratingofinstructors.ItwillbearguedthoughinChapters8,9and10thattheyhave much greater potential for learning. 7.2.6 A paradigm shift It can be seen thateducation has adopted and adapted technology over a long period of time. There aresomeusefullessons tobelearnedfrompastdevelopmentsinthe useoftechnologyforeducation, inparticularthatmanyclaimsmadeforanewlyemergingtechnologyarelikelytobeneithertruenor new.Alsonewtechnologyrarelycompletelyreplacesanoldertechnology.Usuallytheoldtechnology remains, operating within a more specialised ‘niche’, such as radio, or integrated as part of a richer technology environment, such as video in the Internet. However, whatdistinguishesthedigitalagefromallpreviousagesistherapidpaceoftechnology development and our immersion in technology-based activities in our daily lives. Thus it is fairto describethe impact of the Internet on education as a paradigm shift, at least in terms of educational technology. We are still in the process of absorbing and applying the implications. The next section attempts to pin down more closely the educational significance of different media and technologies. 1.Whatconstitutesaneducationaltechnology?HowwouldyouclassifyarecordedlecturefromMITthatis accessed as an open educational resource?

And does it matter? Iwillarguethattherearedifferences,anditdoesmattertodistinguishbetweenmediaandtechnology, especiallyifwearelookingforguidelinesonwhenandhowtousethem.Thereisadanger,particularly in education, in looking too much at the raw technology, and not enough at the personal, social and culturalcontextsinwhich weusetechnology. Theterms‘media’and‘technology’representdifferent ways altogether of thinking about the choice and use of technology in teaching and learning. 331 7.3.2 Technology There are many definitions of technology (see Wikipedia for a good discussion of this). Essentially definitions of technology range from the basic notion of tools, to systems which employ or exploit technologies. Thus •‘technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve real-world problems‘ is a simple definition; •‘the current state of humanity’s knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products, to solve problems, fulfill needs, or satisfy wants‘ is a more complex and grandiose definition (and has a smugness about it that I think is undeserved – technology often does the opposite of satisfy wants, for instance.). Intermsofeducationaltechnologywehavetoconsiderabroaddefinitionoftechnology.Thetechnology of the Internet involves more than just a collection of tools, but a system that combines computers, telecommunications,softwareandrulesandproceduresorprotocols.However,Ibaulkattheverybroad definitionofthe‘current state of humanity’s knowledge‘.Onceadefinitionbeginstoencompassmany different aspects of life it becomes unwieldy and ambiguous. Itend tothinkoftechnologyineducation asthingsortoolsused tosupportteachingandlearning. Thus computers, software programs such as a learning management system, or a transmission or communications network, are all technologies. A printed book is a technology. Technology often includesacombinationoftoolswithparticulartechnicallinksthatenablethemtoworkasatechnology system, such as the telephone network or the Internet. However,forme,technologiesoreventechnologicalsystemsdonotofthemselvescommunicateor createmeaning.Theyjustsitthereuntilcommandedtodosomethingoruntiltheyareactivatedoruntil a person starts to interact with the technology. At this point, we start to move into media. Figure 7.3.2 Don’t just sit there – DO something! Image: © Alex Dawson, Flickr, 2006 7.3.3Media Media (plural of medium) is another word that has many definitions. Theword‘medium’ comesfromthe Latin, meaningin themiddle (amedian) and also thatwhich intermediatesorinterprets.Mediarequireanactiveactofcreationofcontentand/orcommunication,and someonewhoreceivesandunderstandsthecommunication, aswellasthetechnologiesthatcarrythe medium. The term ‘media’ has two distinct meanings relevant for teaching and learning, both of which are different from definitions of technology 7.3.3.1 Media linked to senses and ‘meaning’. We use our senses, such as sound and sight, to interpret media.In this sense, we can consider text, graphics,audioandvideoasmedia‘channels’,inthattheyintermediateideasandimagesthatconvey meaning.Everyinteractionwehavewithmedia,inthissense,isaninterpretationofreality,andagain usually involves some form of human intervention, such as writing (for text), drawing or design for graphics,talking,scriptingorrecordingforaudioandvideo.Notethattherearetwotypesofintervention in media: by the ‘creator’ who constructs information, and by the ‘receiver’, who must also interpret it. Mediaofcoursedependontechnology,buttechnologyisonlyoneelementofmedia.Thus wecan thinkoftheInternetasmerelyatechnologicalsystem,orasamediumthatcontainsuniqueformatsand symbolsystemsthathelpconveymeaningandknowledge.Theseformats,symbolsystemsandunique characteristicsof aparticularmedium(e.g.the280characterlimitinTwitter) aredeliberatelycreated andneedtobeinterpretedbybothcreatorsandendusers.Furthermore,atleastwiththeInternet,people can be at the same time both creators and interpreters of knowledge. Computingcanalsobeconsideredamediuminthiscontext.Iusethetermcomputing,notcomputers, sincealthoughcomputingusescomputers,computinginvolvessomekindofintervention,construction andinterpretation.Computingasamediumwouldincludecoding,animations,onlinesocialnetworking, using a search engine, or designing and using simulations. Thus Google uses a search engine as its primarytechnology, butIclassifyGoogleas amedium,sinceitneeds contentandcontentproviders, andanenduser whodefinestheparameters ofthe search,inaddition tothetechnologyofcomputer algorithms to assist the search.Thus the creation, communication and interpretation of meaning are added features that turn a technology into a medium. In terms of representing knowledge it is useful to think of the following media for educational purposes within which there are sub-systems (only some examples given): • Text: textbooks, novels, poems • Graphics: diagrams, photographs, drawings, posters, graffiti • Audio: sounds, speech, podcasts, radio programs • Video and film: television programs, movies, YouTube clips, ‘talking heads’ • Computing: animation, simulations, online discussion forums, virtual worlds. Furthermore,withinthesesub-systemstherearewaysofinfluencingcommunicationthroughtheuseof uniquesymbolsystems,suchasstorylinesanduseofcharactersinnovels,compositioninphotography, voicemodulationtocreateeffectsinaudio,cuttingandeditinginfilmandtelevision,andthedesignof userinterfacesorwebpagesincomputing.Thestudyoftherelationshipbetweenthesedifferentsymbol systems and the interpretation of meaning is a whole field of study in itself, calledsemiotics. Ineducationwecouldthinkofclassroomteachingasamedium.Technologyortoolsareused(e.g. chalk and blackboards, or Powerpoint and a projector) but the key component is the intervention of the teacher and the interaction with the learners in real time and in a fixed time and place. We can also then think of online teaching as a different medium, with computers, the Internet (in the sense ofthecommunicationnetwork)and alearningmanagementsystem ascoretechnologies,butitisthe interactionbetweenteachers,learnersandonlineresourceswithintheuniquecontextoftheInternetthat are the essential component of online learning. Fromaneducationalperspective,itisimportanttounderstandthatmediaarenotneutralor‘objective’ inhowtheyconveyknowledge.Theycanbedesignedorusedinsuchawayastoinfluence(forgood orbad)theinterpretationofmeaningandhenceourunderstanding.Someknowledgethereforeofhow mediaworkisessentialforteachinginadigitalage.Inparticularweneedtoknowhowbesttodesign and apply media (rather than technology) to facilitate learning. Overtime,mediahavebecomemorecomplex,withnewermedia(e.g.television)incorporatingsome of the components of earlier media (e.g. audio) as well as adding another medium (video). Digital mediaandtheInternetincreasingly areincorporatingandintegratingallpreviousmedia,suchastext, audio,andvideo,andaddingnewmediacomponents,suchasanimation,simulation,andinteractivity. Whendigitalmediaincorporatemanyofthesecomponentstheybecome‘richmedia’.Thusonemajor advantageoftheInternetisthatitencompassesalltherepresentationalmediaoftext,graphics,audio, video and computing. 7.3.3.2Media as organisations The second meaning of media is broader and refers to the industries or significant areas of human activity that are organized around particular technologies, for instance film and movies, television, publishing,andtheInternet.Withinthesedifferentmediaareparticularwaysofrepresenting,organizing and communicating knowledge. Thusforinstance withintelevisionthere aredifferentformats,such asnews,documentaries,game shows, action programs, while in publishing there are novels, newspapers, comics, biographies, and so on. Sometimes theformatsoverlap but even then there are symbol systems within amedium that distinguish it from other media. For instance in movies there are cuts, fades, close-ups, and other techniquesthataremarkedlydifferentfromthoseinothermedia.Allthesefeaturesofmediabringwith them their own conventions and assist or change the way meaning is extracted or interpreted. Lastly,thereisastrongculturalcontexttomediaorganisations.Forinstance,Schramm(1972)found thatbroadcastersoftenhaveadifferentsetofprofessionalcriteriaandwaysofassessing‘quality’inan educationalbroadcastfromthoseofeducators(whichmademyjobofevaluatingtheprogramstheBBC madefortheOpenUniversityveryinteresting).Today,thisprofessional‘divide’canbeseenbetween thedifferencesbetweencomputerscientistsandeducatorsintermsofvaluesandbeliefswithregardto theuseoftechnologyforteaching.Atitscrudest,itcomesdowntoissuesofcontrol:whoisinchargeof usingtechnologyforteaching?WhomakesthedecisionsaboutthedesignofaMOOCortheuseofan animation? 7.3.4The affordances of media Figure 7.3.3 Graphs can represent, in a different way, the same concepts as written descriptions or formulae. Understanding the same thing in different ways generally leads to deeper understanding. Image: © Open University 2013 Different media have different educational effects or affordances. If you just transfer the same teaching to a different medium, you fail to exploit the unique characteristics of that medium. Put more positively, you can do different and often better teaching by adapting it to the medium. That way students will learn more deeply and effectively. To illustrate this, let’s look at an example from early on in my career as a researcher in educational media. 7.3.4.1A personal story In1969,I wasappointedasaresearchofficer attheOpenUniversityintheUnitedKingdom.Atthis pointtheuniversityhadjustreceiveditsroyalcharter. Iwasthe20thmemberofstaffappointed.My jobwastoresearchintothepilotprogramsbeingofferedbytheNationalExtensionCollege,whichwas deliveringlowcostnon-creditdistanceeducationprogramsinpartnershipwiththeBBC.TheNECwas ‘modelling’thekindofintegratedmultimediacourses,consistingofamixofprintandbroadcastradio and TV, that were to be offered by the Open University when it started. My colleague and Isent out questionnaires by mail on a weekly basis to students taking theNECcourses.Thequestionnairecontainedbothpre-codedresponses,andtheopportunityforopen.endedcomments,andaskedstudentsfortheirresponsesto theprintandbroadcastcomponentsofthe courses. We were looking for what worked and what didn’t work in designing multimedia distance education courses. WhenIstartedanalyzingthequestionnaires,Iwasstruckparticularlybythe‘open-ended’comments inresponse tothetelevisionandradiobroadcasts.Responses totheprintedcomponentstended tobe ‘cool’:rational,calm,critical, constructive. Theresponses tothebroadcasts were theopposite:‘hot’, emotional, strongly supportive or strongly critical or even hostile, and rarely critically constructive. Something was going on here. 7.3.4.2Findings from the research: how media differ The initial discovery that different media affected studentsdifferently came very quickly, but it took longer to discover in what ways media are different, and even longer why,but here are some of the discoveries made by my colleagues and mein the Audio-Visual Media Research Group at the OU (Bates, 1984): • the BBC producers (all of whom had a degree in the subject area in which they were making programs) thought about knowledge differently from the academics with whom they were working. In particular, they tended to think more visually and more concretely about the subject matter. Thus they tended to make programs that showed concrete examples of concepts or principles in the texts, applications of principles, or how academic concepts worked in real life. Academic learning is about abstraction and higher order levels of thinking. However, abstract concepts are better understood if they can be related to concrete or empirical experiences, from which, indeed, abstract concepts are often drawn. The television programs enabled learners to move backwards and forwards between the abstract and the concrete. Where this was well designed, it really helped a large number of students – but not all; • students responded very differently to the TV programs in particular. Some loved them, some hated them, and few were indifferent. The ones that hated them wanted the programs to be didactic and repeat or reinforce what was in the printed texts. Interestingly though the TV.haterstended to get lower grades or even fail in the final course exam. The ones that loved theTV programstended to get higher grades. They were able to see how the programs illustrated the principles in the texts, and the programs ‘stretched’ these students to think more widely or critically about the topics in the course. The exception was math, where borderline students found the TV programs most helpful; • the BBC producers rarely used talking heads or TV lectures. With radio and later audio-cassettes, some producers and academics integrated the audio with texts, for instance in mathematics, using a radio program and later audio-cassettes to talk the students through equations or formulae in the printed text (similar to Khan Academy lectures today on video); • using television and radio to develop higher level learning is a skill that can be taught. In the initial foundation (first year) social science course (D100), many of the programs were made in a typical BBC documentary style. Although the programs were accompanied by extensive broadcast notes that attempted to link the broadcasts to the academic texts, many students struggled with these programs. When the course was remade five years later a distinguished academic (Stuart Hall) was used as an ‘anchor’ for all the programs. The first few programs were somewhat like lectures, but in each program Stuart Hall introduced more and more visual clips and helped students analyze each clip. By the end of the course the programs were almost entirely in the documentary format. Students rated the remade programs much higher and used examples from the TV programs much more in their assignments and exams for the remade course. 7.3.4.3 Why are these findings significant? At the time (and for many years afterwards) researchers such as Richard Clark (1983) argued that ‘proper’, scientificresearch showed no significant difference between the use of different media. In particular,therewerenodifferencesbetweenclassroomteachingandothermediasuchastelevisionor radioorsatellite.Eventoday,wearegettingsimilarfindingsregardingonlinelearning(e.g.Meansetal., 2010). However,thisisbecause theresearchmethodologythatisusedbyresearchersforsuchcomparative studiesrequiresthetwoconditionsbeingcomparedtobethesame,exceptforthemediumbeingused (calledmatchedcomparisons,orsometimesquasi-experimentalstudies).Typically,forthecomparison tobescientificallyrigorous,ifyougavelecturesinclass,thenyouhadtocomparelecturesontelevision. If you used another television format, such as a documentary, you were not comparing like with like.Sincetheclassroomwasusedasthebase,forcomparison,youhadtostripoutalltheaffordances oftelevision–whatitcoulddobetterthanalecture–inordertocompareit.IndeedClarkarguedthat whendifferencesinlearning werefoundbetweenthe twoconditions,thedifferences werearesultof using a different pedagogy in the non-classroom medium. Thecriticalpointisthatdifferentmediacanbeusedtoassistlearnerstolearnindifferentwaysand achievedifferent outcomes.Inonesense,researcherssuch asClarkwereright:theteachingmethods matter, but different media can more easily support different ways of learningthan others. In our example,adocumentaryTVprogramaims atdevelopingtheskillsofanalysisandtheapplication or recognitionoftheoreticalconstructs,whereas aclassroomlectureis morefocusedongettingstudents tounderstandandcorrectlyrecall thetheoretical constructs.Thusrequiringthe television program to bejudgedbythesameassessmentmethodsasfortheclassroomlectureunfairlymeasuresthepotential valueoftheTVprogram.Inthisexample,itmaybebetter tousebothmethods:didacticteaching to teachunderstanding,thenadocumentaryapproachtoapplythatunderstanding.(Notethatatelevision program could do both, but the classroom lecture could not.) Perhapsevenmoreimportantistheideathatmanymedia arebetterthan one.Thisallowslearners withdifferentpreferencesforlearningtobeaccommodated,andtoallowsubjectmattertobetaughtin differentwaysthroughdifferentmedia,thusleadingtodeeperunderstandingorawiderrangeofskills in using content. On the other hand, this increases costs. 7.3.5 How dothese findingsapply to digital learning? Digital learning can incorporate a range of different media: text, graphics, audio, video, animation, simulations. We need to understand better the affordances of each medium within the Internet, and usethemdifferently but in an integrated way soastodevelopdeeperknowledge,and a widerrange oflearningoutcomesandskills.Theuseofdifferentmediaalsoallowsformoreindividualizationand personalizationofthelearning,bettersuitinglearnerswithdifferentlearningstylesandneeds.Mostof all,weshouldstoptryingmerelytomoveclassroomteachingtoothermediasuchasMOOCs,andstart designing digital learning so its full potential can be exploited. 7.3.6Implications for education Ifweareinterestedinselectingappropriatetechnologiesforteachingandlearning,weshouldnotjust look at the technical features of a technology, nor even the wider technology system in which it is located,noreventheeducationalbeliefswebringasaclassroomteacher. Wealsoneedtoexaminethe uniquefeaturesofdifferentmedia,intermsoftheirformats,symbolssystems,andculturalvalues.These unique features are increasingly referred to as the affordances of media or technology. The concept of media is much ‘softer’ and ‘richer’ than that of ‘technology’, more open to interpretation andharder todefine,but‘media’is ausefulconcept,inthatit canalsoincorporatethe inclusionofface-to-facecommunicationasamedium.Anotherreasontodistinguishbetweenmediaand technology is to recognise that technology on its own does not of itself lead to the transfer of meaning. As new technologies are developed, and are incorporatedinto media systems, old formats and approachesarecarriedoverfromoldertonewermedia.Educationisnoexception.Newtechnologyis ‘accommodated’tooldformats,aswithclickersandlecturecapture,orwetrytocreatetheclassroom in virtual space, as withlearning management systems.However,new formats,symbolssystemsand organizationalstructuresthatexploittheuniquecharacteristicsoftheInternetasamediumaregradually beingdiscovered.Itissometimesdifficulttoseetheseuniquecharacteristicsclearlyatthispointintime. However,e-portfolios,mobilelearning,openeducationalresourcessuchasanimationsorsimulations, and self-managed learning in large, online social groups are all examples ofways in which we are gradually developingthe unique‘affordances’of the Internet. More significantly, it is likely to be a major mistake to usecomputers to replace or substitute forhumans in the educational process,given the need to create and interpret meaning when using media,atleastuntilcomputershavemuchgreaterfacilitytorecognize,understandandapplysemantics, valuesystems, and organizationalfeatures, which areallimportantcomponentsof‘reading’different media. But at the same time it is equally a mistake to rely only on the symbol systems, cultural valuesandorganizationalstructuresofclassroomteachingasthemeansofjudgingtheeffectivenessor appropriateness of the Internet as an educational medium. Thuswe needa much better understanding of the strengths and limitations of different media for teaching purposes if we are successfully toselectthe right medium for the job. However, given the widely different contextual factors influencing learning,the task of media and technology selection becomes infinitely complex.This is whyit has proved impossible to develop simple algorithms or decisiontreesforeffectivedecisionmakinginthisarea.Nevertheless,therearesomeguidelinesthatcan beusedforidentifyingthebestuseofdifferentmediawithinanInternet-dependentsociety.Todevelop suchguidelinesweneedtoexploreinparticulartheuniqueeducationalaffordancesoftext,audio,video and computing, which is the next task of this chapter. 1.Doyoufindthedistinctionbetweenmediaandtechnologyhelpful?Ifso,howwouldyouclassifythe following (medium or technology): • newspaper • printing press • television program More reading Bates, A.

To dothis we need to identify where media have common or different features. Thereisawiderangeofmediacharacteristicsoraffordancesthatwecouldlookat,butIwillfocuson threethat are particularly important for education: 347 • whether media are broadcast (one-way) or communicative (two way); • whether media are synchronous or asynchronous, includinglive (transient) or recorded (permanent); • whether media are single or rich. Weshallseethatthesecharacteristicsaremoredimensionalthandiscretestates,anddifferentmediawill fitatdifferentpoints onthesedimensions,butthe exactpointonthecontinuumwilldepend tosome extentonthewaytheyaredesignedorused.InthissectionIwillfocusonthebroadcast/communicative dimension. The other two characteristics will be discussed in subsequent sections 7.5.2 Broadcast or communicativemedia A major structural distinction is between ‘broadcast’ mediathat are primarilyone-to-many and one-way, and those mediathat are primarilymany-to-many or ‘communicative’, allowing for two-way or multiple communication connections.Communicative mediainclude those that giveequal ‘power’ of communication between multiple end users. 7.5.2.1Broadcast media Television, radio and print for example are primarily broadcast or one-way media, as end users or ‘recipients’cannotchangethe‘message’(althoughtheymayinterpretitdifferentlyorchoosetoignore it).Notethatitdoes notmatterreallywhatdeliverytechnology(terrestrialbroadcast,satellite, cable, DVD, Internet) is used for television, it remains a ‘broadcast’ or one-way medium. Some Internet technologiesarealsoprimarilyoneway.Forinstance,aninstitutionalwebsiteisprimarilyaone-way technology. Oneadvantageofbroadcastmediaandtechnologiesisthattheyensureacommonstandardoflearning materialsforallstudents.Thisisparticularlyimportantincountrieswhereteachersarepoorlyqualified or of variable quality. Also one-way broadcast mediaenable the organization to control and manage theinformationthatisbeingtransmitted,ensuringqualitycontrolovercontent.Broadcastingmediaand technologies are more likely to be favoured by those with an ‘objectivist’ approach to teaching and learning,sincethe‘correct’knowledge canbetransmitted toeveryonereceivingtheinstruction.One disadvantage is that additional resources are needed to provide interaction with teachers or between learners. 7.5.2.2 Communicative media Thetelephone,video-conferencing,e-mail,onlinediscussionforums,mostsocialmediaandtheInternet areexamplesofcommunicativemediaortechnologies,inthatalluserscancommunicateandinteract with each other, and in theory at least have equal power in technology terms. The educational significanceofcommunicativemediaisthattheyallowforinteractionbetweenlearnersandteachers, and perhaps even more significantly, between a learner and other learners, without the participants needing to be present in the same place. 7.5.2.3Which is which? Thisdimensionis notarigidone,withnecessarilyclear orunambiguousclassifications.Increasingly, technologies are becoming more complex, and able to serve a wide range of functions. In particular the Internet is not so much a single medium as an integrating framework for many different media andtechnologieswithdifferentandoftenoppositecharacteristics.Furthermore,mosttechnologiesare somewhatflexibleinthattheycanbeusedindifferentways.However,ifwestretchatechnologytoo far, for instance trying to make a broadcast medium such as an xMOOC also more communicative, stressesarelikelytooccur.SoIfindthedimensionstilluseful,solongaswearenotdogmaticaboutthe characteristics of individual media or technologies. This means though looking at each case separately. ThusIseealearningmanagementsystemasprimarilyabroadcastorone-waytechnology,although it has features such as discussion forums that allow for some forms of multi-way communication. However, it could be argued that the communication functions in an LMS require additional technologies,suchasadiscussionforum,thatjusthappentobepluggedintoorembeddedwithinthe LMS,whichisprimarilyadatabasewithacoolinterface.Weshallseethatinpracticeweoftenhaveto combinetechnologiesifwewantthefullrangeoffunctionsrequiredineducation,andthisaddscostand complexity. Web sites can vary on where they are placed on this dimension, depending on their design. For instance, an airline web site, while under the full control of the company, has interactive features that allow you to find flights, book flights, reserve seats, and hence, while you may not be able to ‘communicate’ orchange the site, you can at least interact withit and to some extent personalize it. However,youcannotchangethepageshowingthechoiceofflights.ThisiswhyIprefertotalkabout dimensions.Anairlinewebsitethatallowsenduserinteractionislessofabroadcastmedium.However it is not a ‘pure’ communicative mediumeither. The power is not equal between the airline and the customer, because the airline controls the site. Itshouldbenotedtoothatsomesocialmedia(e.g.YouTubeandblogs)arealsomoreofabroadcast than a communicative medium, whereas other social media usemainly communicative technologies with some broadcast features (for example,personal information on a Facebook page). A wiki is clearlymoreofa‘communicative’ medium.Againthoughitneeds tobeemphasizedthatintentional interventionbyteachers,designersorusersofatechnologycaninfluencewhereonthedimensionsome technologieswillbe,althoughtherecomesapointwherethecharacteristicissostrongthatitisdifficult to change significantly without introducing other technologies. The role of the teacher or instructor also tends to be very different when using broadcast or communicativemedia.Inbroadcastmedia,theroleoftheteacheriscentral,inthat contentischosen andoftendeliveredbytheinstructor.xMOOCsareanexcellentexample.However,incommunicative media,whiletheinstructor’s rolemaystillbecentral, asinonlinecollaborativelearning orseminars, therearelearningcontextswheretheremaybenoidentified‘central’teacher,withcontributionscoming from all or many members of the community, as in communities of practice or cMOOCs. Thus it can be seen that ‘power’ is an important aspect of this dimension. What ‘power’ does the end-user or student have in controlling a particular medium or technology? If we look at this from an historical perspective, we have seen a great expansion of technologies in recent years that giveincreasingpowerto theenduser. Themovetowardsmorecommunicativemediaandawayfrom broadcast mediathen has profound implications for education (as for society at large). 7.5.3Applying the dimension to educational media We can also apply this analysis to non-technological means of communication, or ‘media’, such as classroom teaching. Lectures have broadcast characteristics, whereas a small seminar group has communicative characteristics.In Figure 7.5.3, I have placed some common technologies, classroom media and online media along the broadcast/communicative continuum. Figure 7.5.3 The continuum of knowledge dissemination When doing this exercise, it is important to note that: • there is no general normative or evaluative judgement about the continuum. Broadcasting is an excellent way of getting information in a consistent form to a large number of people; interactive communication works well when all members of a group have something equal to contribute to the process of knowledge development and dissemination. The judgement of the appropriateness of the medium or technology will very much depend on the context, and in particular the resources available and the general philosophy of teaching to be applied; • where a particular medium or technology is placed on the continuum will depend to some extent on the actual design, use or application. For instance, if the lecturer talks for 45 minutes and allows 10 minutes for discussion, an interactive lecturemight be further towards broadcasting than if the lecture session is more of a question and answer session; • I have placed ‘computers’ in the middle of the continuum. They can be used as a broadcast medium, such as for programmed learning, or they can be used to support communicative uses, such as online discussion. Their actual placement on the continuum therefore will depend on how we choose to use computers in education; • the important decision from a teaching perspective is deciding on the desired balance between ‘broadcasting’ and ‘discussion’ or communication. That should then be one factor in driving decisions about the choice of appropriate technologies; • the continuum is a heuristic device to enable a teacher to think about what medium or technology will be most appropriate within any given context, and not a firm analysis of where different types of educational media or technology belong on the continuum. Thuswhereamediumortechnology‘fits’bestonacontinuumofbroadcastvscommunicativeisone factor to be considered when making decisions about media or technology for teaching and learning. From the list below: • a blog • online collaborative learning • Twitter • virtual worlds • a podcast • an open textbook 1.

These dimensions are importantforbothfacilitating orinhibiting learning, andforlimiting orenabling moreflexibility for learners. There are actually two closely related dimensions here: • ‘live’ or recorded • synchronous or asynchronous 7.6.1 Live or recorded These are fairly obvious in their meaning. Live media by definition areface-to-face events, such as lectures,seminars,andone-on-oneface-to-facetutorials.A‘live’eventrequireseveryonetobepresent atthesameplaceandtimeaseveryoneelse.Thiscouldbearockconcert,asportseventoralecture. Liveevents,such asforinstance aseminar,workwellwhenpersonalrelations areimportant,suchas buildingtrust, orforchallengingattitudes orpositionsthat areemotionallyorstronglyheld(eitherby studentsorinstructors.) Themaineducationaladvantageofalivelectureisthatitmayhaveastrong emotivequalitythatinspires orencourages learnersbeyondtheactualtransmissionofknowledge, or may provide anemotional‘charge’thatmay helpstudentsshiftfrompreviouslyheld positions.Live events,bydefinition, aretransient.Theymaybewellremembered,butthey cannotberepeated, orif 353 theyare,itwillbe adifferentexperience oradifferentaudience.Thusthereis astrongqualitative or affective element about live events. Recorded media on the other hand are permanently available to those possessing the recording, suchasavideo-cassetteoranaudio-cassette.Booksandotherprintformatsarealsorecordedmedia.The keyeducationalsignificanceofrecordedmediaisthatstudentscanaccessthesamelearningmaterialan unlimited number of times, and at times that are convenient for the learner. Live events of course can also be recorded, but as anyone who has watched a live sports eventcomparedtoarecordingofthesameeventknows,theexperienceisdifferent,withusuallyalesser emotional charge when watching a recording (especially if you already know the result). Thus one mightthinkof‘live’ eventsas‘hot’andrecorded eventsas‘cool.’Recordedmedia canofcoursebe emotionallymoving,suchasagoodnovel,buttheexperienceisdifferentfromactuallytakingpartin the events described. 7.6.2Synchronous or asynchronous Synchronoustechnologiesrequireallthoseparticipatinginthecommunicationtoparticipatetogether,at the same time, but not necessarily in the same place. Thusliveeventsareoneexampleofsynchronousmedia,butunlikeliveevents,technologyenables synchronouslearningwithouteveryonehavingtobeinthesameplace,althougheveryonedoeshaveto participateintheeventatthesametime.Avideo-conferenceorawebinarareexamplesofsynchronous technologieswhichmaybebroadcast‘live’,butnotwitheveryoneinthesameplace.Othersynchronous technologiesaretelevisionorradiobroadcasts.Youhavetobe‘there’atthetimeoftransmission,oryou miss them. However, the ‘there’ may be somewhere different from where the teacher is. Asynchronous technologies enable participants to access information or communicate at different points of time, usually at the time and place of choice of the participant. All recorded media are asynchronous.Books,DVDs,on-demandYou Tubevideos,lecturesrecordedthroughlecturecapture and available for streaming on demand, and online discussion forums are all asynchronous media or technologies. Learners can log on or access these technologies at times and the place of their own choosing. Figure7.6.2illustratesthemaindifferencesbetweenmediaintermsofdifferentcombinationsoftime and place. Figure 7.6.2 The separation of teachers/instructors from learners by time and space 7.6.3 Why does this matter? Overalltherearehugeeducationalbenefitsassociatedwithasynchronousorrecordedmedia,becausethe abilitytoaccessinformationorcommunicateatanytimeoffersthelearnermorecontrolandflexibility. Theeducationalbenefitshavebeenconfirmedinanumberofstudies.Forinstance,Meansetal.(2010) foundthatstudentsdidbetter onblendedlearningbecausetheyspent moretimeontask,becausethe online materials were always available to the students. Research at the Open University found that students much preferred to listen to radio broadcasts recorded on cassette than to the actual broadcast, even though the content and format was identical (Grundin,1981;Batesatal.,1981).However,evengreaterbenefitswerefoundwhentheformatofthe audio was changed to take advantage of the control characteristics of cassettes (stop, replay). It was foundthatstudentslearnedmorefrom‘designed’cassettesthanfromcassetterecordingsofbroadcasts, especially when the cassettes were co-ordinated or integrated with visual material, such as text or graphics.Thiswasparticularlyvaluable,forinstance,intalkingstudentsthroughmathematicalformulae (Durbridge, 1983). This research underlines the importance of changing design as one moves from synchronous to asynchronous technologies. Thus we can predict that although there are benefits in recording live lecturesthroughlecturecapturein termsofflexibilityandaccess, orhavingreadingsavailable atany time or place, the learning benefits would be even greater if the lecture or text was redesigned for asynchronoususe,withbuilt-inactivitiessuchastestsandfeedback,andpointsforstudentstostopthe lecture and do some research or extra reading, then returning to the teaching. The ability to access learning materials on demand (recorded lectures or webinars, learning management systems, web sites, social media) is particularly important for increasing access and flexibilityforlearners,especiallythoseworkingaswellasstudying,forthosewithyoungfamilies,or forstudentswithlongcommutes.Thusthereshouldbeclearlyjustifiedpedagogicalbenefitsthatcould notbeprovidedbytheuseoftechnologyifstudentsmustbepresenteitherinthesameplaceoratthe sametimeasaninstructor.Inparticular,whatarethesocialorpedagogicalreasonswhystudentsshould cometotheschoolorcampusorbepresentatasettimewhensomuchteachingandlearningcannow be done asynchronously? The ability toaccess mediaasynchronously through recorded and streamed materials is oneofthe biggestchangesinthehistoryofteaching,butthedominantparadigminhighereducationisstillthelive lectureorseminar.Thereare,aswehaveseen,someadvantagesinlivemedia,anddirectinter-personal contact, but they need to be used more selectivelyto exploit their unique advantages or affordances. 7.6.4The significance of the Internet Broadcast/communicativeandsynchronous/asynchronousaretwoseparatedimensions.Byplacingthem in a matrix design, we can then assign different technologies to different quadrants, as in Figure 7.6.4below.

This enables us, if we wish, to be very specific about how we design our teaching, so that we can exploit all the characteristics or dimensions of technology to fitalmost any learning context through this one medium. 7.6.5Conclusion It shouldbenoted atthisstagethatalthoughIhaveidentified somestrengthsandweaknessesofthe four characteristics of broadcast/communicative, and synchronous/asynchronous media, we still need an evaluative framework for deciding when to use or combine different technologies. This means developing criteria that will enable us to decide within specific contexts the optimum choice of technologies. References Bates, A.(1981) ‘Some unique educational characteristics of television and some implications for teaching or learning‘Journal of Educational Television Vol. 7, No.3 Durbridge, N.

Thus againdesign is importantforhelping learners to make full educational use of rich media. 7.7.4Simple or rich media? It is a natural tendency when choosing media for teaching to opt for the ‘richest’ or most powerful medium. Why would I use a podcast rather than a video? There are in fact several reasons: • cost and ease of use: it may just be quicker and simpler to use a podcast, especially if it can achieve the same learning objective; • there may be too many distractions in a rich medium for students to grasp the essential point of the teaching. For instance, video recording a busy intersection to look at traffic flow may include all kinds of distractions for the viewer from the actual observation of traffic patterns. A simple diagram or an animation that focuses only on the phenomenon to be observed might be better; • the rich medium may be inappropriate for the learning task. For instance, if students are to follow and critique a particular argument or chain of reasoning, text may work better than a video of a lecturer with annoying mannerisms talking about the chain of reasoning. In general, it is temptingalways to look for the simplest medium first then only opt for a more complexorrichermediumifthesimplemediumcan’tdeliverthelearninggoalsasadequately.However, considerationneedstobegiventomediarichnessasacriterionwhenmakingchoicesaboutmediaor technology,becauserichmediamayenablelearninggoalstobeachievedthatwouldbedifficultwitha simple medium. This is the last of thecharacteristics of media and technology that can influence decisions about teaching and learning.

What matters more is how technologies are applied. The same technology can be applied in different ways, even or especially in education. So in judging the value of a technology, we need to look more closely at the ways in which it is being or could be used. In essence this means focusing more on media – which represent the more holistic use of technologies – than on individualtools or technologies themselves, while still recognising that technology is an essential component of almost all media. 2. By focusing on media rather than technologies, we can then include face-to-face teaching as a medium, enabling comparisons with more technology-based media to be made along a number of dimensions or characteristics. 3. Recognising that in education media are usually used in combination, the sixkey building blocks of media are: 1. face-to-face teaching 2. text 3. (still) graphics 4. audio (including speech) 5. video 6. computing (including animation, simulations and virtual reality) 4. Mediadifferin terms of their formats, symbols systems, and cultural values. These unique features are increasingly referred to as the affordances of media or technology.Thus different media can be used to assist learners to learn in different ways and achieve different outcomes, thus also individualising learning more. 5. There are many dimensions along which some technologies are similar and others are different. By focusing on these dimensions, we have a basis for analysing new media and technologies, to see where they ‘fit’ within the existing landscape, and to evaluatetheir potential benefits or limitations for teaching and learning. 6. There are probably other characteristics or dimensions of educational media that might also be identified, but I believe these threekey characteristics or dimensions to be the most important: 1. broadcast vs communicative 2. synchronous (live) vs asynchronous (recorded) 3. single vs rich media 7. However, the identification of where a particular medium fits along any specific characteristic or dimension will depend in most cases on how that medium is designed. At the same time, there is usually a limit to how far a technology can be forced along one of these dimensions; there is likely to be a single, ‘natural’ position on each dimension, subject to good design, in terms of exploiting the educational affordances of the medium. 8. These characteristics or dimensions of media then need to be evaluated against the learning goals and outcomes desired, while recognising that a new educational medium or application mightenable goals to be achieved that had not been previously considered possible. 9. Over time, mediahave tended to become more communicative, asynchronous, and ‘rich’, thus offering teachers and learners more powerful tools for teaching and learning. 10. The Internet is an extremely powerful medium because through a combination of tools and media it can encompass all the characteristics and dimensions of educational media. 1.

In particular: • text, audio, video, computing and social media all have unique characteristics that make them useful for teaching and learning; • the choice or combination of media will need to be determined by: . the overall teaching philosophy behind the teaching; . the presentational and structural requirements of the subject matter or content; . the skills that need to be developed in learners; . and not least by the imagination of the teacher or instructor (and increasingly learners themselves) in identifying possible roles for different media; • learners now have powerful tools through social media for creating their own learning materials or for demonstrating their knowledge; • courses can be structured around individual students’ interests, allowing them to seek appropriate content and resources to support the development of negotiated competencies or learning outcomes;. • content is now increasingly open and freely available over the Internet; as a result learners can seek, use and apply information beyond the bounds of what a professor or teacher may dictate; • students can create their own online personal learning environments; • many students will still need a structured approach that guides their learning; • teacher presence and guidance is likely to be necessary to ensure high quality learning via social media; • teachers need to find themiddle ground between complete learner freedom and over-direction toenable learners to develop the key skills needed in a digital age. 8.1Thinking about the pedagogical differences of media Figure 8.1.1 Is slow motion a unique characteristic of video?

InthefollowingchapterIwillprovide amodelorsetofcriteria tousewhenmakingdecisionsabout media and technology for teaching. 8.1.2First steps Embeddedwithinanydecisionabouttheuseoftechnologyineducationandtrainingwillbeassumptions 369 about the learning process.We have already seen earlier in this book how different epistemological positionsandtheoriesoflearningaffectthedesignofteaching,andtheseinfluenceswillalsodetermine ateacher’soraninstructor’schoiceofappropriatemedia.Thus,thefirststepistodecidewhatandhow you want to teach. ThishasbeencoveredindepththroughChapters2-5,butinsummary,therearefivecriticalquestions that need to be asked about teaching and learning in order to select and useappropriate media/ technologies: • what is my underlying epistemological position about knowledge and teaching? • what are the desired learning outcomes from the teaching? • what teaching methodswill be employed to facilitate the learning outcomes? • what are the unique educational characteristics of each medium/technology, and how well do these match the learning and teaching requirements? • what resources are available? Thischapterfocuses onthefourthofthesequestions,butthey arebestnotaskedsequentially, butin acyclicaloriterativemanner,asmediaaffordancesmaysuggestalternativeteachingmethodsoreven thepossibilityoflearningoutcomesthathadnotbeeninitiallyconsidered.Whentheuniquepedagogical characteristicsofdifferentmediaareconsidered,thismayleadtosomechangesinwhatcontentwillbe coveredandwhatskillswillbedeveloped.Therefore, atthisstage,decisions oncontentandlearning outcomes should still be tentative. 8.1.3 Identifying the unique educational characteristics of a medium Differentmediahavedifferentpotentialor‘affordances’fordifferenttypesoflearning.Oneoftheartsof teachingisoftenfindingthebestmatchbetweenmediaanddesiredlearningoutcomes.Beforeexploring thisrelationship,first,asummaryofthesubstantialamountofexcellentpastresearchonthistopic(see, forinstance,Trenaman,1967;OlsonandBruner,1974;Schramm,1977;Salomon,1979,1981;Clark, 1983; Bates,1984; Koumi,2006; Berk,2009; Mayer,2009). Thisresearchhasindicatedthattherearethreecoreelementsthatneedtobeconsideredwhendeciding what media to use: • content; • content structure; • skills. OlsonandBruner(1974)claimthatlearninginvolvestwodistinctaspects:acquiringknowledgeoffacts, principles,ideas,concepts,events,relationships,rulesandlaws;andusingorworkingonthatknowledge to develop skills. Again, this is not necessarily a sequential process. Identifying skills then working back to identify the concepts and principles needed to underpin the skills may be another valid way ofworking.Inreality,learningcontentandskillsdevelopmentwilloftenbeintegratedinanylearning process.Nevertheless,whendeciding onmediause,itisuseful tomakeadistinctionbetweencontent andskills. 8.1.3.1.The representation of content Mediadifferintheextenttowhichtheycanrepresent differentkindsofcontent,becausetheyvaryin thesymbolsystems(text,sound,stillpictures,movingimages,etc.)thattheyusetoencodeinformation (Salomon,1979).Wesawinthepreviouschapterthatdifferentmediaarecapableofcombiningdifferent symbolsystems.Differencesbetweenmediainthewaytheycombinesymbolsystemsinfluencetheway in which different media represent content. Thus there is a difference between a direct experience, a writtendescription,atelevisedrecording,andacomputersimulationofthesamescientificexperiment. Different symbol systems are being used, conveying different kinds of information about the same experiment. For instance, our concept of heat can be derived from touch, mathematical symbols (800 celsius), words (random movement of particles), animation, or observance of experiments. Our ‘knowledge’ofheatis asaresultnotstatic,butdevelopmental. Alargepartoflearningrequiresthe mental integration of content acquired through different media and symbol systems. For this reason, deeperunderstandingofaconceptoranideaisoftentheresultoftheintegrationofcontentderivedfrom a variety of media sources (Mayer,2009). Mediaalso differ intheir ability tohandle concrete or abstract knowledge. Abstract knowledge is handledprimarilythroughlanguage.Whileallmediacanhandlelanguage,eitherinwrittenorspoken form, media vary in their ability to represent concrete knowledge. For instance, television can show concrete examples of abstract concepts, the video showing the concrete ‘event’, and the sound track analyzingtheeventinabstractterms.Well-designedmediacanhelplearnersmovefromtheconcreteto the abstract and back again, once more leading to deeper understanding. 8.1.3.2Content structure Mediaalsodifferinthewaytheystructure content.Books,thetelephone,radio,podcastsandface-to.faceteachingalltendtopresentcontentlinearlyorsequentially.Whilethesemediacanrepresentparallel activities(for example, in print, different chapters may deal with events that occursimultaneously butfromdifferentperspectives)suchactivitiesstillhave tobepresentedsequentially.Computersand televisionaremoreabletopresentorsimulatetheinter-relationshipofmultiplevariablessimultaneously occurring. Virtual reality is an exceptionally powerful example of this. Computers can also handle branching or alternative routes through information, but usuallywithin closely defined limits. Subjectmattervariesagreatdealinthewayinwhichinformationneedstobestructured.Subjectareas (forexample,naturalsciences,history)structurecontentinparticularwaysdeterminedbytheinternal logicofthesubjectdiscipline.Thisstructuremaybeverytightorlogical,requiringparticularsequences orrelationshipsbetweendifferentconcepts,orveryopenorloose,requiringlearnerstodealwithhighly complex material in an open-ended or intuitive way. Ifmediathenvarybothinthewaytheypresentinformationsymbolicallyandinthewaytheyhandle the structures required within different subject areas, media which best match the required mode of presentationandthedominantstructureofthesubjectmatterneedtobeselected.Consequently,different subjectareaswillrequireadifferentbalanceofmedia.Thismeansthatsubjectexpertsshouldbedeeply involvedindecisionsaboutthechoiceanduseofmedia,toensurethatthechosenmediaappropriately match the presentational and structural requirements of the subject matter. 8.1.3.3The development of skills Mediaalsodifferinthe extenttowhichthey can helpdevelopdifferent skills.Skills can rangefrom intellectualtopsychomotortoaffective(emotions,feelings).Koumi(2015)hasusedKrathwohl’s(2002) revisionofBloom’sTaxonomyofLearningObjectives(1956)toassignaffordancesoftextandvideoto learning objectives using Krathwold’s classification of learning objectives. Comprehension is likely to be the minimal level of intellectual learning outcome for most education courses. Some researchers (for example, Marton and Säljö,1976) make a distinction between surface and deep comprehension. At the highest level of skills comes theapplication of what one has comprehended to new situations. Here it becomes necessary to develop skills of analysis, evaluation, and problem solving. Thus a first step is to identify learning objectives or outcomes, in terms of both content and skills, while being aware that the use of some media may result in new possibilities in terms of learning outcomes. 8.1.4Pedagogical affordances – or unique media characteristics? ‘Affordances’ is a term originally developed by the psychologist James Gibson (1977) to describe the perceived possibilities of an object in relation to its environment (for example,a door knob suggests to a user that it should be turnedor pulled, while a flat plate on a door suggests that it should be pushed.). The term has been appropriated bya number of fields, including instructional design and human-machine interaction. Thus the pedagogical affordances of a mediumrelate to the possibilities of using that medium for specific teaching purposes.It should be noted that an affordance depends on the subjective interpretation of the user (in this case a teacher or instructor), and it is often possible to use a medium in ways that are not unique to that medium. For instance video can be used for recording and delivering a lecture. In that sense there is a similarity in at least one affordance for alecture and a video. Also students may choose not to use a medium in the way intended by the instructor. For instance, Bates and Gallagher (1977) found that some social science students objected to documentary-style television programs requiring application of knowledge or analysis rather than presentation of concepts. Others (such as myself) have used the term ‘unique characteristics’ of a medium rather than affordances, since ‘unique characteristics’suggest that there areparticular uses of amedium that are less easily replicated by other media, and hence act as a better discriminator in selecting and using media. For instance, using video to demonstrate in slow motion a mechanical process is much more difficult (but not impossible) to replicate in other media. In what follows, my focus is more on unique or particular rather than general affordances of each medium, although the subjective and flexible nature of media interpretation makes it difficult to come to any hard and fast conclusions. I will now attempt in the nextsections to identify some of the unique pedagogical characteristics of the following media: • text; • audio; • video; • computing; • social media • emerging technologies, in particular, virtual/augmented reality, serious games and artificial intelligence. Technically, face-to-faceteachingshouldalsobeconsidered amedium,butIwilllookspecifically at the unique characteristicsof face-to-face teaching in Chapter 10, where I discuss different modes of delivery. 8.1.5Purpose of the exercise Beforestartingontheanalysisofdifferentmedia,itisimportanttounderstandmygoalsinthischapter. IamNOTtryingtoprovideadefinitivelistoftheuniquepedagogicalcharacteristicsofeachmedium.

Even today, textbooks, mainly in printed format, but increasingly also in digital format, still play a major rolein formal education, training and distance education.Many fully online courses still make extensive use oftext-based learning management systems and online asynchronous discussion forums. 375 Whyisthis?Whatmakestextsuchapowerfulteachingmedium,andwillitremainso,giventhelatest developments in information technology? 8.2.1.2Presentational features Text can come in many formats, includingprinted textbooks, text messages, novels, magazines, newspapers,scribblednotes,journalarticles,essays,novels,onlineasynchronousdiscussionsandsoon. The key symbol systems in text are written language(including mathematical symbols)and still graphics,whichwouldincludediagrams,tables,andcopiesofimagessuchasphotographsorpaintings. Colourisanimportantattributeforsomesubjectareas,suchaschemistry,geographyandgeology,and art history. Some of theunique presentational characteristics of text are as follows: • text is particularly good at handlingabstraction and generalisation, mainly through written language; • text enablesthe linear sequencing of information in a structured format; • text can present and separate empirical evidence or data from theabstractions, conclusions or generalisationsderived from the empirical evidence; • text’s linear structure enables the development of coherent, sequential argument or discussion; • at the same time text can relateevidence to argument and vice versa; • text’s recorded and permanent nature enables independent analysis and critique of its content; • still graphics such as graphs or diagrams enable knowledge to be presented differently from written language, either providing concrete examples of abstractions or offering a different way of representing the same knowledge. Thereis someoverlapofeachofthesefeatureswithothermedia,but noothermediumcombinesall these characteristics, or is as powerful as text with respect to these characteristics. Earlier(Chapter2,Section2.7.3)Iarguedthatacademicknowledgeisaspecificformofknowledge that has characteristics that differentiate it from other kinds of knowledge, and particularly from knowledgeorbeliefsbasedsolelyondirectpersonalexperience.Academicknowledgeisasecond-order form of knowledge that seeks abstractions and generalizations based on reasoning and evidence. Fundamental components of or criteria for academic knowledge are: • codification:knowledge can be consistently represented in some form (words, symbols, video); • transparency:the source of the knowledge can be traced and verified; • reproduction: knowledge can be reproduced or have multiple copies; • communicability: knowledge must be in a form such that it can be communicated and challenged by others. Text meetsall fourcriteria above, so it is an essential medium for academic learning. 7.2.1.2Skills development Because of text’s ability to handle abstractions, and evidence-based argument, and its suitability for independentanalysisandcritique,textisparticularlyusefulfordevelopingthehigherlearningoutcomes required at an academic level, such as analysis, critical thinking,and evaluation. It is less useful for showing processes or developing manual skills, for instance. 8.2.2The book and knowledge Figure 8.2.2 What is a book?

Above all, books can provide coherence or a sustained, particular position or approach to a problem or issue, a necessary balancetothechaosandconfusionofthemanynewformsofdigitalmediathatconstantlycompetefor our attention, but in much smaller ‘chunks’ that are overall more difficult to integrate and digest. Another important academic feature of text is that it can be carefully scrutinised, analysed and constantlychecked,partlybecauseitislargelylinear,andalsopermanentoncepublished,enablingmore rigorouschallengeortestingintermsofevidence,rationality,andconsistency.Multimediainrecorded format can come close to meeting these criteria, but text can also provide more convenience and in mediaterms,moresimplicity.ForinstanceIrepeatedlyfindanalysingvideo,whichincorporatesmany variablesandsymbolsystems,morecomplexthananalysingalineartext,evenifbothcontainequally rigorous (or equally sloppy) arguments. 8.2.2.1The form and function of a book Does the form or technological representation of a book matter any more? Is a book still a book if downloaded and read on an iPad or Kindle, rather than as printed text? Forthepurposesofknowledgeacquisition,itprobablyisn’tanydifferent.Indeed,forstudypurposes, adigitalversionisprobablymoreconvenientbecausecarryinganiPadaroundwithmaybehundredsof booksdownloadedonitiscertainlypreferabletocarryingaroundtheprintedversionsofthesamebooks.

It is much more unlikelythoughthatbookswillsurviveinaprintedformat,becausedigitalpublicationallowsformany morefeaturestobeadded,reducestheenvironmentalfootprint,andmakestextmuchmoreportableand transferable. Lastly, this is not an argument for ignoring the academic benefits of new media. The value of graphics,videoandanimationforrepresentingknowledge,theability tointeractasynchronouslywith otherlearners,andthevalueofsocialnetworks,areallunder-exploitedinacademia.Buttextandbooks are still important. 8.2.3 Text and other forms of knowledge Ihavefocusedparticularly ontextandacademicknowledge,becauseofthetraditionalimportanceof textandprintedknowledgeinacademia.Theuniquepedagogicalcharacteristicsoftextthoughmaybe lessforotherformsofknowledge.Indeed,multimediamayhavemanymoreadvantagesinvocational and technical education. Inthek-12orschoolsector,textandprintarelikelytoremainimportant,becausereadingandwriting are likely to remain essentialin a digital age, so the study of text (digital and printed)will remain important if only for developing literacy skills. Indeed,oneofthelimitationsoftextisthatitrequiresahighlevelofpriorliteracyskillsforittobe usedeffectivelyforteachingandlearning,andindeedmuchofteachingandlearningisfocusedonthe developmentofskillsthatenablerigorousanalysisoftextualmaterials.Indeedreadingabilityisoneof thecoreskillsidentifiedforthe21stcentury.Readingandwritingliteracyissomewhatunderattackwith theuseoftruncatedlanguageintextmessages,automatedspellingcorrection,andemotivesymbolsin socialmedia.However,weshouldbegivingasmuchattentiontodevelopingliteracyskillsinusingand interpreting multimedia in a digital age. 8.2.4Assessment If text is critical for the presentation of knowledge and development of skills in your subject area, what are the implications for assessment? If students are expected to develop the skillsthat text appears to develop, then presumably text will be an important medium for assessment.Students will needtodemonstratetheirownabilitytousetexttopresentabstractions,argumentandevidence-based reasoning. In such contexts, composed textual responses, such as essays or written reports, are likely to be necessary, rather than multiple-choice questions or multimedia reports. 8.2.5 More evidence, please Althoughtherehasbeenextensiveresearchonthepedagogicalfeaturesofothermediasuchasaudio, videoandcomputing,texthasgenerallybeentreatedasthedefaultmode,thebaseagainstwhichother mediaarecompared.Asaresultprintinparticularislargelytakenforgrantedinacademia.Wearenow thoughatthestagewhereweneedtopaymuchmoreattentiontotheuniquecharacteristicsoftextinits variousformats,inrelationtoothermedia.Untilthoughwehavemoreempiricalstudiesontheunique characteristics of text and print, text will remain central toat least academic teaching and learning. References Koumi, J.

Audio has been found to be especially useful for: equations, reproductions of paintings, graphs, statistical tables, and even physical rock samples. This technique was later further developed by Salman Khan, but using video to combine voice-over (audio) explanation with visual presentation of mathematical symbols, formulae, and solutions. 8.3.3 Skills development Becauseoftheabilityofthelearnertostopandstartrecordedaudio,ithasbeenfoundtobeparticularly useful for: • enabling students through repetition and practice to master certain auditory skills or techniques (e.g. language pronunciation, analysis of musical structure, mathematical computation); • getting students to analyse primary audio sources, such as children’s use of language, or attitudes to immigration from recordings of interviewed people; • changingstudent attitudesby: . presenting material in a novel or unfamiliar perspective; . by presenting material in a dramatized form, enabling students to identify with someone with a different perspective. 8.3.4Strengths and weaknesses of audio as a teaching medium First, some advantages: • itis much easier to make an audio clip or podcast than a video clip or a simulation; • audiorequires far less bandwidth than video or simulations, hence downloads quicker and can be used over relatively low bandwidths; • it is easily combined with other media such as text, mathematical symbols, and graphics, allowing more than one sense to be used and allowing for ‘integration’; • some students prefer to learn by listening compared with reading; • audio combined with text can help develop literacy skills or support students with low levels of literacy; • audio provides variety and another perspective from text, a ‘break’ in learning that refreshes the learner and maintains interest; • Nicola Durbridge, in her research at the Open University, found that audio increased distance students’ feelings of personal ‘closeness’ with the instructor compared with video or text, i.e. it is a more intimate medium. Inparticular,addedflexibilityandlearnercontrolmeansthatstudentswilloftenlearnbetterfrompre.preparedaudiorecordingscombinedwithaccompanyingtextualmaterial(suchasawebsitewithslides) than they will from a live classroom lecture. There are also of course disadvantages of audio: • audio-based learning is difficult for people with a hearing disability; • creating audio is extra work for an instructor; • audio is often best used in conjunction with othermedia such as text or graphics thus adding complexity to the design of teaching; • recording audio requires at least a minimal level of technical proficiency; • spoken language tends to be less precise than text. Increasinglyvideoisnowbeingusedtocombineaudiooverimages,suchasintheKhanAcademy,but there aremany instances, such aswhere students arestudyingfromprescribed texts, where recorded audio works better than a video recording. So let’s hear it for audio! References Bates, A.

. where resources are scarce, orunsuitable for student experimentation (e.g. live animals, human body parts)(seean example of the anatomy of the brain, from the University of British Columbia); . where the experimental design is complex (for example,testing whether wild sharks are more attracted to blood than fish oil) . where there is an element of risk or danger in conducting the experiment (see an example demonstrating the conservation of momentum) . where the experimental behaviour may be influenced by uncontrollable but observable variables; • illustrate principles involving dynamic change or movement(seean example explaining exponential growth from a course at UBC); • illustrate abstract principles through the use of specially constructed physical models, for instancean animation of a normal curve of distribution; • illustrate principles involving three-dimensional space, for example, seethis video from Nova Scotia Community College • demonstrate changes over timethrough theuse of animation, slow-motion, or speeded-up video(seean example ofhow haemophilus influenzae cells take up DNA, from UBC); • demonstrate correct procedures in health, safety, repairs and maintenance (for an example, seeBrady’s EMR Skills Video) • substitute for a field visit, by: . providing students with an accurate, comprehensive visual picture of asite, in order to place the topic under study in context; for instance seethe Bodo aboriginal archeological site in Alberta . demonstrating the relationship between different elements of asystem under study(e.g. production processes, ecological balanc brady’s EMRe); for example, see thepaper-making process . byidentifying and distinguishing between different classes or categories of phenomena at the site (e.g.in forest ecology); . to observe differences in scale and process between laboratory and mass-production techniques; . through the use of models,animations or simulations, to teach certain advanced scientific or technological concepts (such as theories of relativity or quantum physics) without students having to master highly advanced mathematical techniques; see for instance ‘Einstein’s Theory of Relativity Made Easy.’ • bring students primary resource or case-study material, i.e. recording of naturally occurring events which, through editing and selection, demonstrate or illustrate principles covered elsewhere in acourse; • demonstrate ways in which abstract principles or concepts developed elsewhere in the course have been applied to real-world problems, for example,innovative stormwater management in the University of British Columbia’s Master of Land and Water Management; • synthesise a wide range of variables into a single recorded event, e.g. to suggest howreal world problems can be resolved; • demonstrate decision-making processes or decisions ‘in action’ (e.g. triage in an emergency situation) by: . recording the decision-making process as it occurs in real contexts; . recording ‘staged’ simulations, dramatisation or role-playing, as in the scenarios in Ryerson University’sTherapeutic Communication and Mental Health Assessment Program • demonstrate correct procedures in using tools or equipment (including safety procedures); • demonstrate methods or techniques of performance (e.g. mechanical skills such asstripping and re-assembling a carburetor, sketching, drawing orpainting techniques, ordance); • record and archive events that are crucial to topics in a course, but which may disappear or be destroyed in the near future, such as, for instance, street graffiti or condemned buildings(see an example about neon lights in Vancouver); • demonstrate practical activities to be carried out by students, on their own (for example, see 32 cool experiments to do at home). Figure 8.4.2 Don’t do this yourself at home!

Videoisparticularlyusefulforrecordingeventsorsituationswhereitwouldbetoodifficult,dangerous, expensive or impractical to bring students to such events. Thus its main strengths are as follows: • linking concrete events and phenomenato abstract principles and vice versa; • the ability ofstudents to stop and start, so they can integrate activities with video; • providingan alternative approach to the presentation of content that can help students havingdifficulties in learning abstract concepts; • adding substantial interest to a course by linking it to real world issues; • a growing amount of freely available, high quality academic videos; • good for developing some of the higher level intellectual skills and some of the more practical skills needed in a digital age; • the use of low cost cameras and free editing software enables some forms of video to be cheaply produced. Itshouldalsoberememberedthatinadditiontothefeatureslistedabove,videocanincorporatemanyof the features of audio as well. The main weaknesses of video are: • many faculty have no knowledge or experience in using video other than for recording lecturing; • there is currently a limited amount of high quality educational videofree for downloading, because the cost of developing high quality educational video that exploits the unique characteristics of the medium is still relatively high. Links also often go dead after a while, affecting the reliability of outsourced video. The availability of free material for educational useis improving all the time, but currently finding appropriate and freevideosthat meet the specific needs of a teacher or instructor can be time-consuming or such material may just not be available or reliable; • creating original material that exploits the unique characteristics of video is time-consuming, and still relatively expensive, because it usually needs professional video production; • to get the most out of educational video, students need specially designed activities that often will have to sit outside the video itself; • students often reject videos that require them to do analysis or interpretation; they often prefer direct instruction that focuses primarily on comprehension. Such students need to be trained to use video differently, which requires time to be devoted to developing such skills. Forthesereasons,videoisnotbeingusedenoughineducation.Whenuseditisoftenanafterthoughtor an‘extra’,ratherthananintegralpartofthedesign,orisusedmerelytoreplicateaclassroomlecture, rather than exploiting the unique characteristics of video. 8.4.5Assessment IfvideoisbeingusedtodeveloptheskillsoutlinedinSection8.4.3,thenitisessentialthattheseskills areassessedandcountforgrading.Indeed,onepossiblemeansofassessmentmightbetoaskstudents toanalyseorinterpretaselectedvideo, oreventodeveloptheir ownmediaproject,usingvideothey themselves have collected or produced, using their own devices. References Bates, A.

I prefer ‘computing’ to ‘ICTs’ (information and communications technologies). Computing is a medium while ICT refers more to the technologies used. The Internet in particular is an all-embracing medium that accommodates text, audio, video andcomputing, aswellasprovidingotherelementssuch asdistributedcommunicationand accessto educational opportunities. Computingis also still an area that is fast developing, with new products andservicesemergingallthetime.Indeed,Iwill treatrecent developmentsinsocialmediaandsome emerging technologies separately from computing, although technically they are sub-categories of computing.Onceagain,though,socialmediaandsomeemergingtechnologiescontainaffordancesthat are not so prevalent in more conventional computing-based learning environments. Insuch avolatile medium, it would be foolish to be dogmatic about unique media characteristics, butonceagain,thepurposeofthischapterisnottoprovideadefinitiveanalysis,butawayofthinking abouttechnologythatwillfacilitateaninstructor’schoiceanduseoftechnology.Thefocusis:whatare thepedagogicalaffordancesofcomputingthat aredifferentfromthoseofothermedia(otherthanthe important fact that it can embrace all the other media characteristics)? Althoughtherehasbeenagreatdealofresearchintocomputersineducation,therehasbeenlessfocus onthespecificsofitspedagogicalmediacharacteristics,although agreatdealofinterestingresearch anddevelopmenthastakenplaceandcontinuesinhuman-machineinteractionandtoalesserextentin artificialintelligence.ThusIamrelyingmoreonanalysisandexperiencethanresearchontheunique affordances or characteristics of computing as an educational mediumin this section. 8.5.2Presentational features Figure 8.5.2 Screen size can be a real presentational limitation with smaller, mobile devices Presentationis not really where the educational strength of computinglies.Itcanrepresenttextandaudioreasonablywell, andvideolesswell,becauseofthelimitedsizeofthescreen(and video often has to share screen space with text), and the bandwidth/pixels/download time required. Screen sizecan be a real presentational limitation with smaller, mobile devices, although tablets such as the iPad are a majoradvance in screen quality. However,unliketheothermedia,computingenablestheendusertointeractdirectlywiththemedium, to the extent that the end user (in education, the student) can add to, change or interact with the content,atleasttoacertainextent.Also,morecontroversially,computingcanautomaticallycollectend.userresponsesforanalytics. Inthissense,computing comesclosertoacomplete,ifvirtual,learning environment. Thus in presentational terms computing can be used to: • create and present original teaching content in a rich and varied way (using a combination of text, audio, video and webinars); • enable access to other sources of secondary ‘rich’ content through the Internet; • enable students to communicate both synchronously and asynchronously with the instructor and other students; • structure and manage content through the use of web sites, learning management systems, video servers, and other similar technologies; • create virtual worlds or virtual environments/contexts through technology such as animations,simulations, augmented or virtual reality, and serious games; • set multiple-choice tests, automatically mark such tests, and provide immediate feedback to learners; • enable learners digitally to submit written (essay-type), or multimedia (project-based) assignments through the use of e-portfolios. 8.5.3 Skills development Skills development in a computing environment will once again depend very much on the epistemological approach to teaching. Computing can be used to focus on comprehension and understanding, through a behaviourist approach to computer-based learning (present/test/feedback). However, the communications element of computing also enables more constructivist approaches, through online student discussion and student-created multimedia work. Thus computing can be used (uniquely) to: • develop and test student comprehension of contentthrough computer-based learning/testing; • develop computer coding and other computer-based skills; • develop decision-making skills through theuse of digitally-basedsimulations and/or virtual worlds; • develop skills of reasoning, evidence-based argument, and collaboration through instructor-moderated online discussion forums; • enable students to create their own artefacts/online multimedia work through the use of e-portfolios, thus improving their digital communication skills as well as assessingbetterwhat they have learned; • develop skills of experimental design, through the use of simulations, virtual laboratory equipment and remote labs; • develop skills of knowledge management and problem-solving, by requiring students to find, analyse, evaluate and apply content, accessed through the Internet, to real world problems; • develop spoken and written language skills through both presentation of language and through communication with other students and/or native language speakers via the Internet • collect data on end-user/student interactions with computer and associated equipment such as mobile phones and tablets for: . learning analytics, which can be used to identify weaknesses in the design of the teaching, and student success and failure regarding learning outcomes, including skills development, as well as identifying at-risk students, . adaptive learning, offering learners alternative routes through learning materials, providing an element of personalisation, . assessment (including monitoring), . automated or human feedback. These affordances are in addition to the affordances that other media can support within a broader computing environment. 8.5.4Strengths and weaknesses of computing as a teaching medium Manyteachersandinstructorsavoidtheuseofcomputingbecausetheyfearitmaybeusedtoreplace them, or because they believe it results in a very mechanical approach to teaching and learning. This is not helped by misinformed computer scientists, politicians and industry leaders who argue that computers can replace or reduce the need for humans in teaching. Both viewpoints show a misunderstandingofboththesophisticationandcomplexityofteachingandlearning,andtheflexibility and advantages that computing can bring to teaching. So here are some of the advantages of computing as a teaching medium: • it is a very powerful teaching medium in terms of its unique pedagogical characteristics, in that it can combine the pedagogical characteristics of text, audio, video and computing in an integrated manner; • its unique pedagogicalcharacteristics are useful for teaching manyof the skills learners need in a digital age; • computing can enable learners to have more power and choice in accessing and creating their own learning and learning contexts; • computing can enable learners to interact directly with learning materials and receive immediate feedback, thus, when well designed, increasing the speed and depth of their learning; • computing can enable anyone with Internet access and a computing device to study or learn at any time or place; • computing can enable regular and frequent communication between student, instructors and other students; • computing is flexible enough to be used to support a wide range of teaching philosophies and approaches; • computing can help with some of the ‘grunt’ work in assessment and tracking of student performance, freeing up an instructor to focus on the more complex forms of assessment and interaction with students. On the other hand, the disadvantages of computing are: • many teachers and instructors often have no training in or awareness of thestrengths and weaknesses of computing as a teaching medium; • computing is too often oversold as a panacea for education; it is a powerful teaching medium, but it needs to be managed and controlled by educators; • the traditional user interface for computing, such as pull-down menus, cursor screen navigation, touch control, and an algorithmic-based filing or storage system, while all very functional, are not intuitive and can be quite restricting from an educational point of view. Voice recognition and search interfaces such as Siri and Alexa are an advance, and have potential for education, but at present they have not been used extensively as educational tools (at least by instructors); • there is a tendency for computer scientists and engineers to adopt behaviourist approaches to the use of computingfor education, which not only alienates constructivist-oriented teachers and learners, but also underestimates or underuses the true power of computing for teaching and learning; • despite computing’spower as a teaching medium, there are many aspects of teaching and learning that require direct interaction between a student and teacher – and between students –even or especially in a fully online environment (seeChapter 4, Section 4).The importance of face-to-face, human-to-human contact is probably greater the younger or the less mature the learner, but there will still be many learning contexts where face-to-face contact is necessary or highly desirable even for older or mature learners (this is discussed more in Chapter 10, Section 4).The importance of frequent face-to-face teacher-student interaction is also probably less than many instructors believe, but more than many advocates of computer learning understand.It is not either/or, but finding the right balance in the right context. • computing needs the input and management of teachers and educators, and to some extent learners, to determine the conditions under which computing can best operate as a teaching medium; and teachers need to be in control of thedecisions on when and how to use computing for teaching and learning; • to use computing well, teachers need to work closely with other specialists, such as instructional designers and computer scientists. Theissuearoundthevalueofcomputingasamediumforteachingislessaboutitspedagogicalvalue andmoreaboutcontrol.Becauseofthecomplexityofteachingandlearning,itisessentialthattheuse of computing for teaching and learning is controlled and managed by educators.As long as teachers and instructors have control, and have the necessary knowledge and training about the pedagogical advantagesandlimitationsofcomputing,thencomputingisanessentialmediumforteachinginadigital age. 8.5.5Assessment There is a tendency to focus assessment in computing on multiple choice questions and ‘correct’ answers.

Therehaveneverbeenvastlyinflatedexpectationsabouttheirlikelyimpactoneducation;indeedfora longtimetheyhavebeenwrittenoffastooexpensiveornotappropriateforseriouseducation.However, that view has been changing in recent years. 8.7a.2.1 What are serious games? Thereareseveraldifferentdefinitionsofseriousgames.Ihaveincludedtwodefinitionsthatcoverboth educational and corporate settings. TheFinancial Times Lexiconoffers the following definition: Serious games are games designed for a purpose beyond pure entertainment. They use the motivation levers of game design – such as competition, curiosity, collaboration, individual challenge – and game media, including board games through physical representation or video games, through avatars and 3D immersion, to enhance the motivation of participants to engage in complex or boring tasks. Serious games are therefore used in a variety of professional situations such as education, training, assessment, recruitment, knowledge management, innovation and scientific research. Zhonggen (2019) provides this definition in his comprehensive review of the research on serious games: Serious games are referred to as entertaining tools with a purpose of education, where players cultivate their knowledge and practice their skills through overcoming numerous hindrances during gaming. Itisimportanttodistinguishbetweenseriousgames,game-basedlearningandgamificationbecause of the differences in their purpose, approach and impact on learning. • Game-based learning refers to“the pedagogical approach of utilizing games in education” (Anastasiadis, Lampropoulos and Siakas,2018) • Gamification is defined as the“use of game design elements in non-game contexts” (Deterding et al.,2011) Notethatseriousgamesarenotnecessarilydigital.However,whetherdigitalornot,theyaregoverned by similar principles of of design, such as mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics(Hunicke et al.,2004). 8.7a.2.2 Why use serious games? The main reasons offered for using games in education are to: • improve students’ motivation to learn, • engage learners more deeply in the learning process, • improve learning outcomes, • improve attendance and participation. However, anextensivereviewoftheliterature conductedbyDichevandDichevain 2017foundthat research remains inconclusive on these assumptions. They also found that: • the practice of gamifying learning has outpaced researchers’ understanding of its mechanisms and methods; • insufficient high quality evidence exists to support the long-term benefits of serious games in an educational context; • a limited understanding that how to gamify an activity depends on the specifics of the educational context. DichevandDichevadoconcludethoughthattheirstudydoesnotmeanthatgamificationcannot beused successfully in a learning context; rather better designs and more research are needed. Otherresearchtendstobemorepositive.Hamarietal.(2016)andClarketal.(2016)foundsufficient evidencethat,whenwelldesigned,andundertherightconditions,seriousgamessignificantlyenhanced student learning relative to nongame conditions. Zhonggen(2019)foundamongthe‘huge number of findings in serious game assisted learning, most …are supportive, coupled with a few negative results.’However,themainbenefitstendedtobeinthe affectivedomain(student‘happiness’andimprovedsociallearningandcommunication)ratherthanin immediately improvedcognitivelearningoutcomes,exceptinscience(improvedretentionandholistic understanding), architecture and medicine/health. In the latter, games helped children with autism to learn. Zhonggen reports: ‘Generally, … medical science has recently witnessed clearly more studies on serious game assisted learning compared with other fields and most of studies in medical science supported use of serious games.’ 8.7a.2.3 Examples of serious games TheDigitalEducationStrategiesteam(DES)atRyersonUniversityhasparticipatedinthedevelopment of several virtual games simulations including: Games-based learning:RyersonUniversity’sAcademicIntegrityoffice,incollaborationwithDES, developedadigitallearninggamecalledAcademicIntegrityinSpacetomotivatestudentstocomplete self-studytrainingandtolearnabouttheacademicintegrity,valuesandbehavioursexpectedofstudents.

The game development process consists of three phases: • thepre-production phase, during which brainstorming among team members takes place, leading to the design of a paper prototype of the game; • theproduction phase, when the game is developed; and • thepost-production phase, during which the game is tested and refined before being offered to learners. TheDigitalEducationStrategiesteamutilizedtheDesign,PlayandExperiencemodeltoidentifyfour essential educational game elements: • Learning refers to the content to be learned by players through the game with specific and measurable learning outcomes; • Storytelling refers to the background story of the game and includes a description of the character(s), the setting, and the ultimate goal of the game; • Gameplay refers to the way in which the player interacts with the game, or with other players (if a multiplayer game). It encapsulates the type of activity (e.g., puzzle, trivia, etc.) found in the game; • User Experience refers to the player’s emotions and attitudes while playing the game, as well as how the player interacts with the game. Figure8.7a.4providesamoredetailedrepresentationofthevariouscomponentsoftheRyersonserious game design methodology. Figure 8.7a.4 Serious game design methodology, from Djafarova er al., 2018 TheDigitalEducationStrategies’reportsuggests aworkshopapproach toseriousgamesdesign,in whichallthekeystakeholders(contentexperts,instructionaldesigners,mediaproducers,andsoforth) are involved.

Click on image to see video As with serious games, virtual and augmented reality are technologies that have been around for sometimewhilemakingarelativelysmallimpactoneducationintheirearlierdevelopment.However morerecenttechnologicaldevelopmentsthathavemovedvirtualworldsfromtwo-dimensions(suchas SecondLife) into three-dimensional, deeply immersive environments have brought more attention to theirpotentialineducation(foragoodoverviewofthehistoryandpotentialofaugmentedandvirtual reality in education, see Elmqadden,2019). 8.7b.1 What are virtual/augmented/mixed reality? A simple definition of these technologies is‘human immersion in a synthetic world‘ (Seidel and Chatelier,1997).TheFranklinInstituteprovidesthefollowingmoredetaileddefinitionsthatattemptto distinguish between the different types of ‘synthetic’ worlds: Augmented reality (AR) adds digital elements to a live view often by using the camera on a smartphone. Examples of augmented reality experiences include Snapchat lenses and the game Pokémon Go. Virtual reality (VR) implies a complete immersion experience that shuts out the physical world. Using VR devices such as HTC Vive, Oculus Rift or Google Cardboard, users can be transported into a number of real-world and imagined environments such as the middle of a squawking penguin colony or even the back of a dragon. In a mixed reality (MR) experience, which combines elements of both AR and VR, real-world and 423 digital objects interact. Mixed reality technology is just now starting to take off, with Microsoft’s HoloLens one of the most notable early mixed reality apparatuses. Iwillusetheterm‘immersivetechnologies’forallthesetechnologies.However,verbaldescriptions will always be somewhat inadequate in describing what are essentially multi-sensory experiences, combiningvision,hearingandmovement.Thesetechnologiesaresomethingthatneedtobeexperienced rather than explained if they are to be better understood. 8.7b.2 Why use immersive technologies? There are several reasons why these technologies are beginning to be used more in education: • the recent development of relatively low cost and easily wearable end-user technology (headsets in particular); • deep immersion into three-dimensional, highly realistic learning environments that are strongly compelling/motivating for the end user; • the ability for end users to manipulate objects within the three dimensional environment; • more powerful cloud computing technology that allows for the development of more complex and more realistic learning environments, combined with more advanced developments in mobile technologies and high-speed wireless networks; • the potential for developing a range of skills and knowledge that would be difficult, impossible or dangerous in real-world environments. 8.7b.3 Examples of immersive environments in education Looking at the challenges above, it may be wondered why anyone would bother with immersive technologies in education. However, the potential benefits have barely been explored. I provide examplesherethatdemonstrateboththepotentialbenefitsandhowsomeimmersiveenvironmentscan be developed relatively easily. 8.7b.3.1 Virtual reality In the Department of Chemistry at the University of Bristol in England, Dr. David Glowacki and his team in their VR laboratory created an interactive molecular dynamics modelling tool in the form ofNano Simbox VR, which allowed anyone to visit and play within the invisible molecular world (O’Connor et al.,2018).The main aim of this particular project was to provide an intuitive feeling of the way molecules operate in multiple dimensions to enable researchers and students to have a better understanding of how nano worlds operate, leading to better hypotheses for testing within this particular domain. As the authors state in the article: From a modeling perspective, the nanoscale represents an interesting domain, because the objects of study (for example, molecules) are invisible to the naked eye, and their behavior is governed by physical forces and interactions significantly different from those forces and interactions that we encounter during our day-to-day phenomenological experience. In domains like this, which are imperceptible to the naked eye, effective models are vital to provide the insight required to make research progress….molecular systems typically have thousands of degrees of freedom. As a result, their motion is characterized by a complicated, highly correlated, and elegant many-body dynamical choreography, which is nonintuitive compared to the more familiar mechanics of objects that we encounter in the everyday physical world. Their combined complexity, unfamiliarity, and importance make molecules particularly interesting candidates for investigating the potential of new digital modeling paradigms. GlowackiandhisteaminScienceAdvances(O’Connoretal.,2018)describehowtheVRappenabled researchers to: • easily “grab” individual C60atoms and manipulate their real-time dynamics to pass the C60back and forth between each other. • take hold of a fully solvated benzylpenicillin ligand and interactively guide it to dock it within the active site of the TEM-1 .-lactamase enzyme (with both molecules fully flexible and dynamic) and generate the correct binding mode (33), a process that is important to understanding antimicrobial resistance • guide a methane molecule (CH4) through a carbon nanotube, changing the screw sense of an organic helicene molecule, • tie a knot in a small polypeptide [17-alanine (17-ALA) Figure 8.7b.2 The use of virtual reality to foster chemical intuition Dr. David Glowacki, University of Bristol.

The instructor, Dr. Siobhán McPhee, has developed a mobile appthat follows the stories of five Syrian refugees who eventually reached Vancouver. Students are forced to make choices (or given a lack of choice), wait, and run/ walk with the app to be able to progress the narrative of the experience.The purpose of this project is to evoke empathy and help students understand the emotional consequences of the Syrian Civil War.This app also applies some gamification principles as well. 8.7b.4 Designing immersive educational environments This technology is so recent that there are few or no accepted best practices developed yet for educational use. Most educational applications to date have been deliberately exploratory in nature. However,thereareseveralstagesofdevelopmentrequiredthatwillapplytoalleducationalapplications of these technologies: • identify start-up costs and possible sources of funding: this is not likely to be a cheap exercise, at least initially; for this reason, several universities, such as theUniversity of British Columbia, andDrexel University, have set up their own emerging technologies research labs to experiment with educational applications; • define learning outcomes/objectives: what is the learner expected to learn? In the early stages of development this may be both a brainstorming exercise (preferably including students/end.users) and an iterative process, because the full potential of the technology is not always clear in first applications. In particular, the instructor needs to have a clear vision of what might be possible using an immersive technology. Thus some familiarity with the technology is essential before starting design; • determine where the use of this technology fits within the overall design of a course/program: in other words, what knowledge and skills will be developed within the immersive environment, and how does this integrate with what is being taught in the rest of the course/ program? • decide between using an existing immersive design/learning environment that can be applied or adapted relatively easily for ‘local’ use; or designing a new immersive environment from scratch. The latter is obviously more expensive and time-consuming and will require a high level of expertise; as a result the pay-off from design from scratch (improved learning outcomes/return on investment) needs to be worth the effort; • choice of appropriate/affordable technology. Headsets or mobile apps are the least expensive part of the use of immersive technologies. The main cost will be in developing or adapting the ‘augmented’ or ‘virtual’ world. However, as with serious games, there can be an intermediary step, where an existing ‘world’ can be licensed and adapted for local use (see for instance,Lightwave). In some cases, open access immersive worlds are available for use or adaptation, although they are not common (seeOpenSimulator,Art of Illusion,orMayaVerse, for examples.). Often students can be used to help with programming and design of the environment, as part of their studies, but they will need direction as well as the opportunity to offer creative ideas. Truly interactive virtual worlds where learners/users make decisions and the consequences are ‘programmed’ into the learning environment may require large amounts of computing capacity, such as cloud computing; • to be effective, the VR environment has to be as authentic or realistic as possible. This means paying as much attention to creating the specific learning context. It will be necessary to decide what parts of the learning will best be done outside the VR/AR experience, and which inside. For instance, the procedures for monitoring the state of a nuclear reactor, for identifying critical incidents, for deciding whether or not or when to shut down the reactor, and for actually shutting down the reactor must also be built in to the learning process. Most of this may be taught outside the VR context, but VR can be used to test or develop the skills of applying this knowledge in a realistic, challenging context. In other words, the VR experience needs to be embedded within a broader learning context or environment; • testing and adaptation: design, at least initially, needs to be an iterative process, where ideas are developed and tried, and feedback received and incorporated into the design; • assessment: this can be a particular challenge, particularly if new learning outcomes result from the experience. How can assessment best capture what students have learned? Will assessment take place within the ‘virtual’ world, in the real world, or in some other way (and if so, how authentic will such an assessment be)? • in what ways could the new immersive environment be scaled up to enable costs to be recovered? • evaluation: what is the best way to evaluate the success or limitations of the design and application of the immersive world? How best to disseminate the knowledge and experience gained? These may appear formidable challenges, but the potential benefits could be considerable. 8.7b.5 The unique characteristics of immersive technologies The development of fully immersive technologies is so recent that it is premature to try to identify all the educational affordances that are unique to this medium. New applications are being explored all the time. Most of the evidence is qualitative, based on people’s personal experience of using the technology. Empirical evidence that validates specific educational affordances of VR/AR in terms of improvedlearningoutcomesiscurrentlylacking.However,thepotential ofVR/ARintermsofassisting learning can be identified. Firstofall,manyoftheaffordances oreducationalcharacteristicsofothermedia,andinparticular video, will apply to VR and AR, but often more intensely, because of the immersive experience. Virtualandaugmentedrealityapplicationscanprovidestudentswithadeep,intuitiveunderstanding of phenomena that are otherwise difficult if not impossible to achieve in other ways. This enables students who often struggle with the abstract nature of an academic subject to understand in more concretetermswhattheabstractionsmeanorrepresent.Thisintuitiveunderstandingiscriticalnotonly for deeper understanding but also for breakthroughs in research and applications of science. Educationalapplicationswherethecostofalternativeortraditionalwaysoflearningaretooexpensive or too dangerous, will be particularly suitable for virtual reality applications. Examples might be emergencymanagement,suchasshuttingdownanout-of-controlnuclearreactor,ordefusingabomb, or managing a fire on an oil tanker, or exploring inside the physical structure of a human brain.In particular, VR would be appropriate for learning in contexts where real environments are not easily accessible,orwherelearnersneed tocopewithstrongemotionswhenmakingdecisions oroperating under pressure in real time. AR, which is often easier to design and implement, enables learners to practice applications of knowledge in semi-realistic contexts. However,atthetimeofwritingwearejustbeginningtounderstandthepotentialofthismedium.Over time, the educational affordances of this medium will become much clearer. 8.7b.6 Strengths and weaknesses VRisnotjustafadthatwilldisappear.Therearealreadyalargenumberofcommercialapplications, mainlyinentertainmentandpublicrelations,butalsoincreasinglyforspecific areasofeducationand training.Thereisalready alotofexcellent,off-the-shelfsoftwareforcreatingVRenvironments,and thecostofhardwareisdroppingrapidly(althoughgoodqualityheadsetsandotherequipmentarestill probably too expensive for required use by large numbers of students). Thefieldsofapplicationofthistechnologyareunlimited:trainingintheuseofcomplexequipment, simulationofsurgicalprocedures,architecturaldesigntesting,thereconstructionofsitesinarcheology, virtual museum visits, treatment of pain and phobias, and many other possibilities. To enablethe moreemotionalaspectsofdecisionmaking tobehandled,theimmersiveexperience needs to be realistic. This will probably require high quality media production.

One of the authors, Alan Kingstone, concluded: “Using VR to examine how people think and behave in real life may very well lead to conclusions that are fundamentally wrong. This has profound implications for people who hope to use VR to make accurate projections regarding future behaviours. For example, predicting how pedestrians will behave when walking amongst driverless cars, or the decisions that pilots will make in an emergency situation. Experiences in VR may be a poor proxy for real life.” Rolfsen,2019 Thismeansweneedmoreexperimentation.Thisisstillarelativelynewtechnology,andtheremay beverysimplewaystouseitineducationthatarenotcostlyandmeetneedsthatcannotbeeasilymet intraditionalteachingorwithotherexistingtechnology.Forthistohappen,though,educators,software developers, and media producers need to come together to play, experiment, test and evaluate. Nevertheless, VR and AR are exciting technologies with the potential to change radically conventional learning processes. References Brandaõ,G.etal.(2018)VirtualRealityasaToolforTeachingArchitectureinDesign, User Experience, and Usability: Designing Interactions Las Vegas NV: Proceedings of 7th International Conference, DUXU 2018, held as Part of HCI International 2018, Connolly,B.(2018)HowvirtualrealityistransforminglearningattheUniversityofNewcastle,CIO, 8 March Elmqadden, N.

AI is also currently going through yet another period of extreme hype as a panacea for education,currentlybeingatthetopofthepeakofinflatedexpectations,butthishypeisdrivenmainly bysuccessfulapplicationsoutsidethefieldofeducation,suchasinfinanceandmarketing.Furthermore the term ‘AI’ is increasingly being used (incorrectly) as a general term for any computational activity. Even in education, there are very different possible areas of application of AI.Zeide (2019) 433 makesaveryusefuldistinctionbetweeninstitutional,studentsupportandinstructional applications (Figure 8.7.c.2 below). Figure 8.7c.2 AI applications in education Image: © Zeide, 2019 AlthoughAIapplicationsforinstitutionalorstudentsupportpurposesareveryimportant,thischapter is focused on the pedagogical affordances of different media and technologies (what Zeide calls ‘instructional’applications).Inparticular,thefocusinthissectionwillbeontheroleofAIasaform of media or technology for teaching and learning, its pedagogical affordances, and its strengths and weaknesses in this area. Moreover, AI is really a sub-set of computing.

An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves. Zawacki-Richteretal.(2019),inareviewoftheliteratureonAIinhighereducation,reportthatthose authors that defined artificial intelligence tended to describe it as: intelligent computer systems or intelligent agents with human features, such as the ability to memorise knowledge, to perceive and manipulate their environment in a similar way as humans, and to understand human natural language. Klutka et al. (2018) also define AI in terms of what it can do in higher education (Figure 8.7.c.3 below): Figure 8.7.c. 3 What AI can do in education Image: Klutka et al. (2018) There are three basic computing requirements that set ‘modern’ AI apart from other computing applications: • access to massive amounts of data; • computational power on a large scale to manage and analyze the data; • powerful and relevant algorithms for the data analysis. 8.7c.3 Why use artificial intelligence for teaching and learning? There are two somewhat different goals for the general use of artificial intelligence. The first is to increase the efficiency of a system or organization, primarily by reducing the high costs of labour, namely by replacing relatively expensive human workers with relatively less costly machines (automation). In education in particular, the main cost is that of teachers and instructors. Politicians, entrepreneursandpolicymakersincreasinglyseeamovetoautomationasawayofreducingthecosts of education. Thesecondis toincreasetheeffectivenessofteachingandlearning,ineconomic termstoincrease outputs: better learning outcomes and greater benefits for the same or more cost. With this goal, AI would be used alongside or supporting teachers and instructors. Klutkaetal.(2018)provideageneralstatementofthepotentialofAIinhighereducation‘instruction’ through Figure 8.7c.4: Figure 8.7c.4 Goals for AI in higher education instruction Image: Klutka et al.

They’re trained on sets of hundreds of example essays to recognize patterns that correlate with higher or lower human-assigned grades. They then predict what score a human would assign an essay, based on those patterns. FeathersthoughclaimsthatresearchfrompsychometriciansandAIexpertsshowthatthesetoolsare susceptible to a common flaw in AI: bias against certain demographic groups (see Ongweso,2019). Lazendic et al. (2018)offer a detailedaccount of the plan for machine grading in Australian high schools. Theystate: It is …crucially important to acknowledge that the human scoring models, which are developed for each NAPLAN writing prompt, and their consistent application, ensure and maintain the validity of NAPLAN writing assessments. Consequently, the statistical reliability of human scoring outcomes is fundamentally related to and is the key evidence for the validity of NAPLAN writing marking. Inotherwords,themarkingmustbebasedonconsistenthumancriteria.However,itwasannounced later (Hendry, 2018) thatAustralian education ministers agreed not to introduce automated essay marking for NAPLAN writing tests, heeding calls from teachers’ groups to reject the proposal. Perelman(2013)developedacomputerprogramcalledtheBABELgeneratorthatpatchedtogether strings of sophisticated words and sentences into meaningless gibberish essays. The nonsense essays consistently received high, sometimes perfect, scores when run through several different scoring engines.See also Mayfield, 2013, and Parachuri, 2013, for thoughtful analyses of the issues in the automated marking of writing. Atthetimeofwriting,despiteconsiderablepressuretouseautomatedessaygradingforstandardized exams, the technology still has many questions lingering over it. 8.7c.5Strengths and weaknesses There are several ways to assess the value of the teaching and learning affordances of particular applications of AI in teaching and learning: • is the application based on the three core features of ‘modern’ AI: massive data sets, massive computing power; powerful and relevant algorithms? • does the application have clear benefits in terms of affordances over other media, and particularly general computing applications? • does the application facilitate the development of the skills and knowledge needed in a digital age? • is there unintended bias built into the algorithms? Does it appear to discriminate against certain categories of people? • is the application ethical in terms of student and teacher/instructor privacy and their rights in an open and democratic society? • are the results of the application ‘explainable’? For example, can a teacher or instructor or those responsible for the application understand and explain to students how the results or decisions made by the AI application were reached? These issues are addressed below. 8.7c.5.1 Is it really a ‘modern’ AI application in teaching and learning? LookingattheZawacki-Richteretal.studyandmanyotherresearchpaperspublishedinpeer-reviewed journals,veryfewso-calledAIapplicationsinteachingandlearningmeetthecriteriaofmassivedata, massivecomputingpowerandpowerfulandrelevantalgorithms.Muchoftheintelligenttutoringwithin conventional education is what might be termed ‘old’ AI: there is not a lot of processing going on, andthedatapoints arerelativelysmall.Manyso-calledAIpapersfocused onintelligenttutoringand adaptive learning are really just general computing applications. Indeed,so-calledintelligenttutoringsystems,automatedmultiple-choicetestmarking,andautomated feedbackonsuchtestshavebeenaroundsincetheearly1980s.TheclosesttomodernAIapplications appear to be automated essay grading of standardised tests administered across an entire education system.Howevertherearemajorproblemswiththelatter.Moredevelopmentisclearlyneededtomake automated essay grading a valid exercise. The main advantage that Klutka et al. (2018) identify for AI is thatit opens up the possibility for higher education services to become scalable at an unprecedented rate, both inside and outside the classroom.However,itisdifficulttoseehow‘modern’AIcouldbeusedwithinthecurrenteducation system, where class sizes or even whole academic departments, andhence data points, are relatively small,intermsofthenumbersneededfor‘modern’AI.ItcannotbesaidtodatethatmodernAIhasbeen tried, and failed, in teaching and learning; it’s not really even been tried. Applicationsoutsidethe currentformalsystem aremorerealistic,forMOOCs,forinstance, orfor corporatetrainingonaninternationalscale,orfordistanceteachinguniversitieswithverylargenumbers ofstudents.Therequirementformassivedatadoessuggestthatthewholeeducationsystemcouldbe massively disrupted if the necessary scale could be reached by offering modern AI-based education outsidetheexistingeducationsystems,forinstancebylargeInternetcorporationsthatcouldtaptheir massive markets of consumers. However,thereisstillalongwayto gobeforeAImakesthatfeasible.Thisisnotto saythatthere couldnotbesuchapplicationsofmodernAIinthefuture,butatthemoment,inthewordsoftheold English bobby, ‘Move along, now, there’s nothing to see here.’ However,forthesakeofargument,let’sassumethatthedefinitionofAIofferedhereistoostrictand thatmostoftheapplicationsdiscussedinthissectionareexamplesofAI.Howdotheseapplicationsof AI meet the other criteria above? 8.7c.5.2 Do the applicationsfacilitate the development of the skills and knowledge needed in a digital age? This does not seem tobethe case in most so-called AI applications forteaching and learning today. Theyareheavilyfocusedoncontentpresentationandtestingforunderstandingandcomprehension.In particular,Zawacki-Richteretal.makethepointthatmostAIdevelopmentsforteachingandlearning– oratleasttheresearchpapers–arebycomputerscientists,noteducators.SinceAItendstobedeveloped by computer scientists, they tend to use models of learning based on how computers or computer networkswork(sinceofcourseitwillbeacomputerthathastooperatetheAI).Asaresult,suchAI applicationstend toadoptaverybehaviouristmodeloflearning:present/test/feedback.Lynch(2017) argues that: If AI is going to benefit education, it will require strengthening the connection between AI developers and experts in the learning sciences. Otherwise, AI will simply ‘discover’ new ways to teach poorly and perpetuate erroneous ideas about teaching and learning. Comprehension and understanding are indeed important foundational skills, but AI so far is not helping with the development of higher order skills in learners of critical thinking, problem-solving, creativityandknowledge-management.Indeed,Klutkaetal.(2018)claimthatthatAIcanhandlemany oftheroutinefunctionscurrentlydonebyinstructorsandadministrators,freeingthemuptosolvemore complex problems and connect withstudents on deeper levels. This reinforces theviewthat therole of the instructor or teacher needs to move away from content presentation, content management and testingofcontentcomprehension–allofwhichcanbedonebycomputing–towardsskillsdevelopment. ThegoodnewsisthatAIusedinthiswaysupportsteachersandinstructors,butdoesnotreplacethem. Thebadnewsisthatmanyteachersandinstructorswillneedtochangethewaytheyteachortheywill become redundant. 8.7c.5.3 Is there unintended bias in the algorithms? It could be argued that all AI does is to encapsulate the existing biases in the system. The problem though is that this bias is often hard to detect in any specific algorithm, and that AI tends to scale up or magnify such biases. These are issues more for institutional uses of AI, but machine-based bias can discriminate against students also in a teaching and learning context as well, and especially in automated assessment. 8.7c.5.4Is the application ethical? There are many potential ethical issues arising from the use of AI in teaching and learning, mainly duetothelackoftransparencyintheAIsoftware,andparticularlytheassumptionsembeddedinthe algorithms. The literature review by Zawacki-Richter et al. (2019) concluded: …a stunning result of this review is the dramatic lack of critical reflection of the pedagogical and ethical implications as well as risks of implementing AI applications in higher education. Whatdata arebeingcollected,who ownsorcontrolsit,howisitbeinginterpreted,howwillitbe used?Policieswillneedtobeputinplacetoprotectstudentsandteachers/instructors(seeforinstance the U.S. Department of Education’s student data policies for schools), and students and teachers/ instructors need to be involved in such policy development. 8.7c.5.5 Are the results explainable? The biggest problem with AI generally, and in teaching and learning in particular, is the lack of transparency. Howdiditgive methisgrade?WhyI amdirectedtothisreadingratherthanthatone? Whyisn’tmyansweracceptable?Lynch(2017)arguesthatmostdatacollectedaboutstudentlearningis indirect,inauthentic,lackingdemonstrablereliabilityorvalidity,andreflectingunrealistictimehorizons to demonstrate learning. ‘current examples of AIEd often rely on …. poor proxies for learning, using data that is easily collectable rather than educationally meaningful.’ 8.7c.6 Conclusions 8.7c.6.1. Dream on, AI enthusiasts IntermsofwhatAIisactuallydoingnowforteachingandlearning,thedreamiswaybeyondthereality. Whatworkswellinfinance ormarketingorastronomydoes notnecessarilytranslate toteachingand learningcontexts.Indoingtheresearchforthissection,itprovedverydifficulttofindanycompelling examplesofAIforteachingandlearning,comparedwithseriousgamesorvirtualreality.Itisalways hardtoproveanegative,buttheresultstodateofapplyingAItoteachingandlearningareextremely limited and disappointing. This is mainly due to the difficultyofapplying‘modern’ AI at scale in a very fragmented system thatreliesheavilyonrelativelysmallclasssizes,programs,andinstitutions.ProbablyformodernAIto ‘work’,atotallydifferent organizational structureforteachingandlearningwouldbeneeded.Butbe careful what you wish for. Thereisastrongaffectiveoremotionalinfluenceinlearning.Studentsoftenlearnbetterwhenthey feel that theinstructor orteacher cares.Inparticular, studentswant tobetreated asindividuals, with theirowninterests,waysoflearning,andsomesenseofcontrolovertheirlearning.Althoughatamass levelhumanbehaviourispredictableandtosomeextentcontrollable,eachstudentisanindividualand willrespondslightlydifferentlyfromotherstudentsinthesamecontext.Becauseoftheseemotionaland personalaspectsoflearning,studentsneedtorelateinsomewaytotheirteacherorinstructor.Learning isacomplexactivity whereonly arelatively minorpartoftheprocess canbeeffectivelyautomated.

In contrast, the keylessonfromallAIdevelopmentsisthatwewillneedtopayincreasedattentiontotheaffectiveand emotional aspects of life in a robotic-heavy society, so teachers will become even more important. Anotherproblemwithartificialintelligenceisthatthesameoldhypekeepsgoingroundandround. The same arguments for using artificial intelligence in education go back to the 1980s. Millions of dollars went into AI research at the time, including into educational applications, with absolutely no payoff. Therehavebeen somesignificantdevelopmentsinAIsincethen,inparticularpatternrecognition, access to and analysis of big data sets, powerful algorithms, leading to formalized decision-making withinlimitedboundaries.Thetrickthoughistorecogniseexactlywhatkindofapplicationsthesenew AI developments are good for, and what they cannot do well. In other words, the context in which AIisusedmatters,andneeds tobetaken accountof.Teachingandlearningis aparticularlydifficult environment then for AI applications. 8.7c.6.4 Defining AI’s role in teaching and learning Nevertheless, there is plenty of scope for useful applications of AI in education, but only if there is continuingdialoguebetweenAIdevelopersandeducatorsasnewdevelopmentsinAIbecomeavailable. ButthatwillrequirebeingveryclearaboutthepurposeofAIapplicationsineducationandbeingwide awake to the unintended consequences. Ineducation,AIisstillasleepinggiant.‘Breakthrough’applicationsofAIforteachingandlearning are probably not going to come from the mainstream universities and colleges, but from outside the formal post-secondary system, through organizations such as LinkedIn, lynda.com, Amazon or Coursera,thathaveaccesstolargedatasetsthatmaketheapplicationsofAIscalableandworthwhile (tothem).However, thiswouldpose anexistentialthreat topublicschools,collegesanduniversities. The issue then becomes: what system is best to protect and sustain the individual in a digital age: multinationalcorporationsusingAIforteachingandlearning;orapubliceducationsystemwithhuman teachers using AI as a support for learners? Thekeyquestiontheniswhethertechnologyshouldaimtoreplaceteachersandinstructorsthrough automation, or whether technology should be used to empower not only teachers but also learners. Above all, who should control AI in education: educators, students, computer scientists, or large corporations? These are indeed existential questions if AI does become immensely successful in reducingthecostsofteachingandlearning:butatwhatcosttousashumans?FortunatelyAIisnotyet in a position to provide such a threat; but it may well do so soon. References Bayne,S.(2014)Teacherbot:interventionsinautomatedteachingTeaching in Higher Education,Vol. 20.

In responding to this challenge, the following needs to be considered: 1. New technologies are not necessarily better than existing technologies for teaching. They may however offer new opportunities for teaching differently, and may enable new or better learning outcomes, as well as improving on existing learning outcomes. 2. Old technologies rarely disappear completely as a result of popular new technologies. Older technologies become more focused and find a niche that they serve best. 3. Most educators will be best served by not jumping on the latest technology bandwagon, but should wait a couple of years for a particular technology to reach at least the Gartner ‘slope of enlightenment’ before experimenting with the new technology. 4. More important than the general characteristics of a new technology is its design and application in education; in other words, how does it perform as an educational medium? Being a big success in the financial sector for instance does not mean a technology will be automatically appropriate for education. Indeed, the technology may need to be heavily adapted or modified to be useful in the educational sector. 5. Given the rate of change and the number of new technologies entering the market, educators need a strong framework or set of criteria for selecting and evaluating technologies, not just emerging technologies but also existing technology. This will be discussing in the following final section of this chapter. 8.8 A framework for analysingthe pedagogical characteristics of educational media 8.8.1Brief summary of pedagogical differences in media I will now summarise the unique pedagogical characteristics of the different media discussed in thischapter. Figure 8.8.1 presents a diagrammatic analysis of various learning media. I have arranged them primarily by where they fit along an epistemological continuum of objectivist (black), constructivist (blue)andconnectivist(red),butalsoIhaveusedtwootherdimensions,teachercontrol/learnercontrol, andcredit/non-credit.Notethatthisfigurealsoenablestraditionalteachingmodes,suchaslecturesand seminars, to be included and compared. Figure 8.8.1 represents mypersonal interpretation of these 451 media,andotherteachersorinstructorsmaywellre-arrangethediagramdifferently,dependingontheir particular applications of these tools. Notalltoolsormediaarerepresentedhere(forexample,audioandvideoorMOOCs).Theposition ofanyparticulartoolinthediagramwilldependonitsactualuse.Learningmanagementsystemscan beusedinaconstructivistway,andblogscanbeveryteacher-controlled,iftheteacheristheonlyone permitted to use a blog on a course.

These applications would be much more learner driven, with the learnerdecidingonthetoolsandtheiruses.ThemostpowerfulexamplesareconnectivistorcMOOCs, as we saw in Chapter 5. 8.8.2 Key takeaways There is a very wide range of media available for teaching and learning. In particular: • text, audio, video, computing, social media and emerging technologies all have unique characteristics that make them useful for teaching and learning; • the choice or combination of media will need to be determined by: . the overall teaching philosophy behind the teaching; . the presentational and structural requirements of the subject matter or content; . the skills that need to be developed in learners; . and not least by the imagination of the teacher or instructor (and increasingly learners themselves) in identifying possible roles for different media; • learners now have powerful tools through social media for creating their own learning materials or for demonstrating their knowledge; • courses can be structured around individual students’ interests, allowing them to seek appropriate content and resources to support the development of negotiated competencies or learning outcomes;. • content is now increasingly open and freely available over the Internet; as a result learners can seek, use and apply information beyond the bounds of what a professor or teacher may dictate; • students can create their own online personal learning environments; • many students will still need a structured approach that guides their learning; • teacher presence and guidance is likely to be necessary to ensure high quality learning via social media; • teachers need to find themiddle ground between complete learner freedom and over-direction toenable learners to develop the key skills needed in a digital age. References Arenas, E.

However, media selection needs to be integrated within the broader framework of course design. 9.1Models for media selection Figure 9.1.1 The SECTIONS model 9.1.1 What theliterature tells us Given the importance of the topic, there is relatively little literature on how to choose appropriate media or technologies for teaching. There was a flurry of not very helpful publications on this topic in the 1970s and1980s, but relatively little since (Baytak,undated). Indeed,Koumi (1994)statedthat: there does not exist a sufficiently practicable theory for selecting media appropriate to given topics, learning tasks and target populations . . . the most common practice is not to use a model at all. In which case, it is no 457 wonder that allocation of media has been controlled more by practical economic and human/political factors than by pedagogic considerations (p. 56). Mackenzie (2002) comments in a similar vein: When I am discussing the current state of technology with teachers around thecountry, it becomes clear that they feel bound by their access to technology,regardless of their situation. If a teacher has a television-computer setup, then that iswhat he or she will use in the classroom. On the other hand, if there is an LCD projectorhooked up to a teacher demonstration station in a fully equipped lab, he or she will bemore apt to use that set up. Teachers have always made the best of whatever they’vegot at hand,but it’s what we have to work with.Teachers make due. Mackenzie (2002) has suggested building technology selection around Howard Gardner’smultiple intelligences theory (Gardner,1983,2006), following the following sequence of decisions: learner.teaching objective.intelligences.media choice. Mackenzie then allocates different media to support the development of each of Gardner’s intelligences. Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences has been widely tested and adopted,and Mackenzie’sallocationsofmediatointelligencesmakesenseintuitively,butofcourseitisdependent on teachers and instructors applying Gardner’s theory to their teaching. Areviewofmorerecentpublicationsonmediaselectionsuggeststhatdespitetherapiddevelopments inmediaandtechnologyoverthelast20years,myACTIONSmodel(Bates,1995)isoneofthemajor modelsstillbeingapplied,althoughwithfurtheramendmentsandadditions(seeforinstance,Baytak, undated;LambertandWilliams,1999;Koumi,2006).Indeed,ImyselfmodifiedtheACTIONSmodel, which was developed for distance education, to the SECTIONS model to cover the use of media in campus-based as well as distanceeducation (Bates and Poole,2003). Patsula (2002) developed a model called CASCOIME which includes some of the criteria in the Bates models, but also adds additional and valuable criteria such as socio-political suitability, cultural friendliness,and openness/flexibility, to take into account international perspectives. Zaied (2007) conducted an empirical study to test what criteria for media selection were considered important by faculty, IT specialists and students, and identified seven criteria. Four of these matched or were similar to Bates’ criteria. The other three were student satisfaction, student self-motivation and professional development, which are more like conditions for success and are not really easy to identify before making a decision. Koumi (2006) and Mayer (2009) have come closest to to developing models of media selection. Mayer has developed twelve principles of multimedia design based on extensive research, resulting in what Mayer calls a cognitive theory of multimedia learning. (For an excellent application of Mayer’s theory, seeUBC Wikis.) Koumi (2015) more recently has developed a model for deciding on the best mix and use of video and print to guide the design of xMOOCs. Mayer’s approach is valuable at a more micro-level when it comes to designing specific multimedia educational materials, as is Koumi’s work. Mayer’s cognitive theory of multimedia designsuggests the best combination of words and images, and rules to follow such as ensuring coherence and avoiding cognitive overload. When deciding to use a specific application of multimedia, it provides very strong guidelines. It is nevertheless more difficult to apply at a macro level.Because Mayer’sfocus is on cognitive processing, his theorydoes not deal directly with the unique pedagogical affordances or characteristics of different media. Neither Mayer nor Koumi address non-pedagogical issues in media selection, such as cost or access.Mayer and Koumi’s work isnot so much competing as complementary to what I am proposing. I am trying to identify which media (or combinations of media) to use in the first place. Mayer’s theory then would guide the actual design of the application. I will discuss Mayer’s twelve principlesfurther in Section 5 of this chapter, which deals with teaching functions. Puentedura’s SAMR model (2014), discussed inChapter 7, Section 4, is valuable for assessing the choice of a particular medium, but it focuses solely on pedagogical issues, particularly in terms of whether the choice augments or transforms learning. Although this is a powerful criterion for media selection, the SAMR model does not take into account other essential factors in media selection, such as cost or ease of use. It is not surprising that there are not many models for media selection. The models developedin the 1970s and 1980s took avery reductionist, behaviourist approach to media selection, resulting in often several pages of decision-trees, which are completely impractical to apply, given the realities of teaching, and yet these models still included no recognition of the unique affordances of different media. More importantly, technology is subject to rapid change, there are competing views on appropriate pedagogical approaches to teaching, and the context of learning varies so much. Finding a practical, manageable model founded on research and experience that can be widely applied has proved to be challenging. 9.1.2 Why we need a model At the same time, every teacher,instructor, and increasingly learner, needs to make decisions in this area, often on a daily basis.A model for technology selection and application is needed therefore that has the following characteristics: • it will work in a wide variety of learning contexts; • it allows decisions to be taken at both a strategic, institution-wide level, and at a tactical, instructional, level; • it gives equal attention to educational and operational issues; • it will identify critical differences between different media and technologies, thus enabling an appropriate mix to be chosen for any given context; • it is easily understood, pragmatic and cost-effective; • it will accommodate new developments in technology. For these reasons, then, I will continue to use the Bates’ SECTIONS model, with some modifications to take account of recent developmentsin technology,research and theory.The SECTIONS modelis based on research, has stood the test of time, and has been found to be practical. SECTIONS stands for: • S tudents • E ase of use • C ost • T eaching functions, includingpedagogical affordances of media • I nteraction • O rganizational issues • N etworking • S ecurity and privacy Iwilldiscusseachofthesecriteriainthefollowingsections,andwillthensuggesthow toapplythe model. References Bates, A.

This will be discussed furtherinChapter 10. 9.2.2Access Of all the criteria in determining choice of technology, this is perhaps the most discriminating. No matterhowpowerfulineducationaltermsaparticularmediumortechnologymaybe,ifstudentscannot accessitin aconvenientandaffordable mannertheycannotlearnfromit.Thusvideostreamingmay beconsideredagreatwaytogetlecturestostudentsoffcampus,butiftheydonothaveInternetaccess athome,orifittakesfourhoursoraday’swagestodownload,thenforgetit.Difficultyofaccessisa particularrestrictiononusingxMOOCsindevelopingcountries.EvenifpotentiallearnershaveInternet ormobilephoneaccess,which3.8billiongloballystilldonot(ITU,2018),itoftencostsaday’swages to download a single YouTube video – seeMarron, Missen and Greenberg, 2014. Anyteacherorinstructorintendingtousecomputers,tabletsormobilephonesforteachingpurposes needs answers to a number of questions: • what is the institutionalpolicy with regard to students’ access to a computer, tablets or mobile phones? • can studentsuse any device or is there a limited list of devices that the institution will support? • is the medium or software chosen for teaching compatible with all makes of devices students might use? • is the network adequate to support any extra students that this initiative will add? • who else in the institutionneeds to know that you are requiring students to use particular devices? If students are expected to provide their own devices (which increasingly makes sense): • what kind of devicedo they need: one at home with Internet access or a portable that they can bring on to campus – or one that can be used both at home and on campus? • what kind of applications will they need to run on their device(s) for study purposes? • will they be able to use the same device(s)across all courses, or will they need different software/apps and devicesfor different courses? • what skills will studentsneed in operating the devices and the apps that will be run on them? • if students do not have the skills, would it still be worth their learning them, and will there be time set aside in the course for them to learn these skills? Students(as well astheinstructor) need toknowthe answersto thesequestions beforetheyenrolin a course or program. In order to answer these questions, you and your department must know what students will use their devices for. There is no point in requiring students to go to the expense of purchasingalaptopcomputeriftheworktheyarerequiredtodoonitisoptionalortrivial.Thismeans some advance planning on your part: • what are the educational advantages that you see in student use of a particular device? • what will students need to do on the devicein your course? • is it really essential for them to use a devicein these ways, or could they easily manage without the device? In particular, how will assessment be linked to the use of the device? Itwillreallyhelpifyourinstitutionhasgoodpoliciesinplaceforstudenttechnologyaccess(seeSection 9.7).Iftheinstitutiondoesnothaveclearpoliciesorinfrastructureforsupportingthetechnologiesyou want to use,then your job is going to be a lot harder. Theanswertothequestionofaccessandthechoiceoftechnologywillalsodependsomewhatonthe mandateoftheinstitutionandyourpersonaleducationalgoals.Forinstance,highlyselectiveuniversities canrequirestudentstouseparticulardevices,andcanhelptherelativelyfewstudentswhohavefinancial difficultiesinpurchasingandusingspecifieddevices.Ifthoughthemandateoftheinstitutionistoreach learnersdeniedaccesstoconventionalinstitutions,equitygroups,theunemployed,theworkingpoor,or workersneedingup-gradingormoreadvancededucationandtraining,thenitbecomescritical tofind outwhattechnologytheyhaveaccesstoorarewillingtouse.Ifaninstitution’spolicyisopenaccess to anyone who wants to take its courses, the availability of equipment already in the home (usually purchased for entertainment purposes) becomes of paramount importance. Anotherimportantfactortoconsiderisaccessforstudentwithdisabilities.Thismaymeanproviding textual or audio options for deaf and visually impaired students respectively. Fortunately there are nowwellestablishedpracticesandstandardsunderthegeneralheadingofUniversalDesignstandards. Universal Design isdefined as follows: Universal Design for Learning, or UDL, refers to the deliberate design of instruction to meet the needs of a diverse mix of learners. Universally designed courses attempt to meet all learners’ needs by incorporating multiple means of imparting information and flexible methods of assessing learning. UDL also includes multiple means of engaging or tapping into learners’ interests. Universally designed courses are not designed with any one particular group of students with a disability in mind, but rather are designed to address the learning needs of a wide-ranging group. Brokop, F. (2008) Most institutions with a centre for supporting teaching and learning will be able to provide assistance to faculty to ensure the course meets universal design standards. For instance, BCcampus has produced anaccessibility toolkit(Coolidge et l.,2018) and Norquest College, Alberta, has publisheda detailed guide to ensuring online materials are accessible for persons with disabilities. 9.2.3Student differences with respect to learning with technologies It may seem obvious that different students will have different preferences for different kinds of technology or media. The design of teaching would cater for these differences. Thus if students are ‘visual’learners,theywouldbeprovidedwithdiagramsandillustrations.Iftheyareauditorylearners, they will prefer lectures and podcasts. It might appear then that identifying dominant learning styles shouldthenprovidestrongcriteriaformediaandtechnologyselection.However,itisnotassimpleas that. McLoughlin(1999),inathoughtfulreviewoftheimplicationsoftheresearchliteratureonlearning styles for the design of instructional material, concluded that instruction could be designed to accommodate differences in both cognitive-perceptual learning styles and Kolb’s (1984) experiential learningcycle.In astudyof newintakesconducted overseveralyears attheUniversityofMissouri-Columbia, using the Myers-Briggs inventory, Schroeder (1993) found that new students think concretely, and are uncomfortable with abstract ideas and ambiguity. However,amajorfunctionofauniversityeducationistodevelopskillsofabstractthinking,andto helpstudentsdealwithcomplexityanduncertainty.Perry(1970)foundthatlearninginhighereducation is a developmental process. It is not surprising then that many students enter college or university withoutsuch‘academic’skills.Indeed,therearemajorproblemsintryingtoapplylearningstylesand othermethodsofclassifyinglearnerdifferencestomediaandtechnologyselectionanduse.Laurillard (2001) makes the point that looking at learning styles in the abstract is not helpful. Learning has to belookedatincontext.Thinkingskillsinonesubjectareadonotnecessarilytransferwelltoanother subjectarea.Therearewaysofthinkingthatarespecifictodifferentsubjectareas.Thuslogical-rational thinkers in science do not necessarily make thoughtful husbands, or good literary critics. Partofauniversityeducationistounderstandandpossiblychallengepredominantmodesofthinking inasubjectarea.Whilelearner-centeredteachingisimportant,studentsneedtounderstandtheinherent logic,standards,andvaluesofasubjectarea.Theyalsoneedtobechallenged,andencouragedtothink outsidethebox.Inparticular,atauniversitylevelweneedstrategiestograduallymovestudentsfrom concretelearningbasedonpersonalexperiencetoabstract,reflectivelearningthatcanthenbeapplied to new contexts and situations. Technology can be particularly helpful for that, as we saw in Chapter 8. Thuswhendesigningcourses,itisimportant tooffer arangeofoptionsforstudentlearningwithin the same course. One way to do this is to make sure that a course iswell structured, with relevant ‘core’informationeasilyavailabletoallstudents,butalsotomakesurethatthereareopportunitiesfor studentstoseekoutnewordifferentcontent.Thiscontentshouldbeavailableinavarietyofmediasuch as text, diagrams, and video, with concrete examples explicitly related to underlying principles. The increasingavailabilityofopeneducationalresources(discussedinChapter11.2)makestheprovisionof this ‘richness’ of possible content much more viable. Similarly,technologyenablesarangeoflearneractivities tobemadeavailable,suchasresearching readings on the Web, online discussion forums, synchronous presentations, assessment through e-portfolios, and online group work. The range of activities increases the likelihood that a variety of learnerpreferencesarebeingmet,andalsoencourageslearnerstoinvolvethemselvesinactivitiesand approachestolearningwheretheymayinitiallyfeellesscomfortable.Thusitisimportanttoensurethat students have a wide range of media (text, audio, video, computing) within a course or program. Lastly, one should be careful in the assumptions made about student preferences for learning throughdigitaltechnologies.Ontheonehand,technology‘boosters’suchasMarkPrensky(2001)and DonTapscott(2008)havearguedthattoday’s‘digitalnatives’aredifferentfrompreviousgenerations of students. They argue that today’s students live within a networked digital universe and therefore expecttheirlearningalsotobealldigitallynetworked.Itisalsotruethatprofessorsinparticulartend tounderestimatestudents’ accesstoadvancedtechnologies(professors areoftenlateadoptersof new technology),soyoushouldalwaystrytofindup-to-dateinformationonwhatdevicesandtechnologies students are currently using, if you can. On the other hand, it is also dangerousto assume that all students are highly ‘digital literate’ and aredemandingthat newtechnologiesshouldbeusedinteaching.JonesandShao(2011)conducted a thoroughreview of the literature on‘digital natives’, with over200 appropriate references, including surveysofrelevantpublicationsfromcountriesinEurope,Asia,NorthAmerica,AustraliaandSouth Africa.They concluded that: • students vary widely in their use and knowledge of digital media; • the gap between students and their teachers in terms of digital literacy is not fixed, nor is the gulf so largethat it cannot be bridged; • there is little evidence that students enter university with demands for newtechnologies that teachers and universities cannot meet; • students will respond positively to changes in teaching and learning strategies that include the use of new technologies that are well conceived, well explained and properly embedded in courses and degreeprogrammes. However there is no evidence of a pent-up demand amongststudents for changes in pedagogy or of a demand for greater collaboration; • the development of university infrastructure, technology policies and teaching objectives should be choices about the kinds of provision that the university wishes to make and not a response to general statements about what a new generation of students are demanding; • the evidence indicates that young students do not form a generational cohort and they do not express consistent or generationally organised demands,thus challenging general assumptions about the differences between post-millennials, millennials, Generation X and boomers in the way that they learn. GraduatingstudentsthathavebeeninterviewedaboutlearningtechnologiesattheUniversityofBritish Columbiamadeitclearthattheywillbehappytousetechnologyforlearningsolongasitcontributesto theirsuccess(inthewordsofonestudent,‘ifitwillgetmebettergrades’)butthestudentsalsomadeit clearthat it was the instructor’s responsibility to decide what technology was best for their studies. It is also important to pay attention to what Jones and Shao are not saying. They are not saying thatsocialmedia,personallearningenvironments,orcollaborativelearningareinappropriate,northat theneedsofstudentsandtheworkforce areunchangingorunimportant,butthe useofthesetools or approaches should be driven by a holistic look at the needs of all students, the needs of the subject area,andthelearninggoalsrelevanttoadigitalage,andnotbyanerroneousviewofwhataparticular generation of students are demanding. In summary, one great advantage of the intelligent application of technology to teaching is that it providesopportunitiesforstudentstolearninavarietyofways,thusadaptingtheteachingmoreeasilyto studentdifferences.Thus,thefirststepinmediaselectionistoknowyourstudents,theirsimilaritiesand differences,whattechnologiestheyalreadyhaveaccessto,andwhatdigitalskillstheyalreadypossess orlackthatmayberelevantforyourcourses.Thisislikelytorequiretheuseofawiderangeofmedia within the teaching to accommodate these differences. 9.2.4 The information you need about your students It is critical to know your students.In particular, you need the following information to provide an appropriate context for decisions about media and technology: 1.Whatisthemandateorpolicyofyourinstitution,departmentorprogramwithrespecttostudent accessingeneral(selectivevsopen;accommodationofdisabilities,etc.)?Howwillstudentswhodonot have access to a chosen technology be supported? 2.

The exceptions of course are where technology is the area of study, such as computer science or engineering, or where learning the use of software toolsiscriticalforsomeaspectsofthecurriculum,forinstancecomputer-aideddesigninarchitecture, 469 spreadsheets in business studies, and geographical information systems in geology. In most cases, though,theaimofthestudyisnottolearnhowtouseaparticularpieceofeducationaltechnology,but the study of history, mathematics, or biology. One advantage of face-to-face teaching is that it needs relatively little advance preparation time compared with for instance developing a fully online course. Media and technologies vary in their capacityforspeedofimplementationandflexibilityinup-dating.Forinstance,blogsaremuchquicker andeasier todevelopanddistributethanvirtualreality. Teachersandinstructorsthen aremuchmore likelytousetechnologythatisquickandeasytouse,andstudentslikewisewillexpectsuchfeaturesin technologytheyaretouseforstudying.However,what’s‘easy’forinstructorsandstudentstousewill depend on their digital literacy. 9.3.2 Computer and information literacy Ifagreatdealoftimehastobespentbythestudentsandteachersinlearninghowtouseforinstance softwareforthedevelopmentordeliveryofcoursematerial,thisdistractsfromthelearningandteaching. Of course, there is a basic set of literacy skills that will be required, such as the ability to read and write, to use a keyboard, to use word processing software, to navigate the Internet and use Internet software,andincreasinglytousemobiledevices.Thesegenericskillsthoughcouldbeconsideredpre.requisites. If students have not adequately developed these skills in school, then an institution might provide preparatory courses for students on these topics. Itwillmakelifealoteasierforbothteachersandstudentsifaninstitutionhasstrategiesforsupporting students’ useofdigital media.Forinstance, attheUniversityofBritishColumbia, the Digital Tattoo project prepares students for learning online in a number of ways: • introducing students to a range of technologies that could be used fortheir learning, such as learning management systems, open educational resources, MOOCs and e-portfolios; • explaining what’s involved in studying online or at a distance; • setting out the opportunities and risks of social media; • advice on how to protect their privacy; • how to make the most of connecting, networking and online searching; • how to prevent cyber-bullying; • maintaining a professional online presence. Ifyourinstitutiondoes nothavesomethingsimilar, thenyoucoulddirectyourstudents totheDigital Tattoo site, which is fully open. Itisnotonlystudentsthoughwhomayneedpriorpreparation.Technologycanbetooseductive.You canstartusingitwithoutfullyunderstandingitsstructureorhowitworks.Evenashortperiodoftraining –anhourofless–onhowtousecommontechnologiessuchasalearningmanagementsystemorlecture capture could save you a lot of time and more importantly, enable you to see the potential value of allfeaturesand not just those that you stumble across. 9.3.3Orientation A usefulstandard or criterion for the selection of course media or software is that ‘novice’ students (studentswhohave neverusedthesoftwarebefore)shouldbestudyingwithin20minutesoflogging on. This 20minutes maybeneeded toworkoutsome ofthe keyfunctions ofthe softwarethatmay be unfamiliar, orto work out how the course Web site is organized and navigated. This is more of an orientation period though than learning new skills of computing. If there is aneed to introduce newsoftwarethatmaytake alittletime tolearn,forinstance, asynchronous‘chat’facility, orvideo streaming,itshouldbeintroducedatthepointwhereitisneeded.Itisimportantthoughtoprovidetime within the course for the students to learn how to do this. 9.3.4Interface design Thecriticalfactorinmakingtechnologytransparentisthedesignoftheinterfacebetweentheuserand themachine.ThusaneducationalprogramorindeedanyWebsiteshouldbewellstructured,intuitive for the user to use, and easy to navigate. Interfacedesignis ahighlyskilledprofession,andisbased onacombinationofscientificresearch intohowhumanslearn,anunderstandingofhowoperatingsoftwareworks,andgoodtrainingingraphic design.Thisisonereasonwhyitisoftenwisetousesoftwareortoolsthathavebeenwellestablishedin education, because these have been tested and been found to work well. The traditionalgeneric interface of computers – a keyboard, mouse, and graphic user interface of windowsandpull-downmenusandpop-upinstructions–isstillextremelycrude,andnotisomorphic withmostpeople’s preferencesforprocessinginformation.Itplacesveryheavyemphasis onliteracy skills and a preference for visual learning. This can causemajor difficultiesfor students with certain disabilities, such as dyslexia or poor eyesight. However, in recent years, interfaceshave started to become more user friendly,with touch screen and voice activated interfaces. Neverthelessagreatdealofeffortoftenhastogointotheadaptationofexistingcomputerormobile interfacestomakethemeasy touseinaneducationalcontext.TheWebisjust asmuchaprisonerof thegeneralcomputerinterfaceasanyothersoftwareenvironment,andtheeducationalpotentialofany Websiteisalsorestrictedbyitsalgorithmicortree-likestructure.Forinstance,itdoesnotalwayssuit the inherent structure of some subject areas, or the preferred way of learning of some students. There are several consequences of these interface limitations for teachers and instructors: • it is really important to choose teaching software or other technologies that are intuitively easy to use, both by the students in particular, but also for the teacher/instructor in creating materials and interacting with students; • when creating materials for teaching, the teacher needs to be aware of the issues concerning navigation of the materials and screen lay-out and graphics. While it is possible to add stimulating features such as audio and animated graphics, this comes at the cost of bandwidth. Such features should be added only where they serve a useful educational function, as slow delivery of materials is extremely frustrating for learners, who will normally have slower Internet access that the teacher creating the materials. Furthermore, web-based layout on desktop or laptop computers does not automatically transfer to the same dimensions or configurations on mobile devices, and mobile devices have a wide range of standards, depending on the device. Given that the design of Web-based materials requires a high level of specialized interface design skill, it is preferable to seek specialist help, especially if you want to use software or media that are not standard institutionally supported tools. This is particularly important when thinking of using new mobile apps, for instance; • third, we can expect in the next few years some significant changes in the general computer interface with the development of speech recognition technology, adaptive responses based on artificial intelligence, and the use of haptics(e.g. hand-movement) to control devices. Changes in basic computer interface design could have as profound an impact on the use of technology in teaching as the Internet has. 9.3.5Reliability Thereliabilityandrobustnessofthetechnologyisalsocritical.Mostofuswillhavehadthefrustration oflosingworkwhenourwordprogrammingsoftwarecrashesorworking‘inthecloud’andbeinglogged off in the middle of a piece of writing.

Some of the questions then that you need to consider are: 1. How intuitively easy to use, both by students and by yourself, is the technology you are considering? 2. How reliable is the technology? 3. How easy is it to maintain and upgrade the technology? 4. The company that is providing the critical hardware or software you are using: is it a stable company that is not likely to go out of business in the next year or two, or is it a new start.up? What strategiesare in place to secure any digital teaching materials you createshould the organisation providing the software or service cease to exist? 5. Do you have adequate technical and professional support, both in terms of the technology and with respect to the design of materials? 6. How fast developing is this subject area? How important is it to regularly change the teaching materials? Which technology will best support this? 7. To what extent can the changes be handed over to someone else to do, and/or how essential is it for youto do them yourself? 8. What rewards am I likely to get for using new technology in my teaching? Will use of a new technologybe the only innovation, or can I also change my way of teaching with this technology to get better results? 9. What are the risks in using this technology? 9.4Cost Figure 9.4.1 Total cost of a fully online masters’ course over 7 years (from Bates and Sangrà, 2011).

You can listen to it online here: https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/teachinginadigitalagev2/?p=230 475 9.4.1 A revolution in media Untilasrecently asten yearsago, cost was amajor discriminator affecting thechoice oftechnology (Hülsmann, 2000, 2003; Rumble, 2001; Bates, 2005). For instance, for educational purposes, audio (lectures, radio,audio-cassettes) was far cheaper thanprint,whichin turnwasfarcheaper than most forms of computer-based learning, which in turn was far cheaper than video (television, cassettes or video-conferencing).Allthesemediawereusuallyseenaseitheraddedcoststoregularteaching,ortoo expensivetousetoreplaceface-to-faceteaching,exceptforpurelydistanceeducationonafairlylarge scale. However,therehavebeendramaticreductionsinthecostofdevelopinganddistributingallkindsof media (except face-to-face teaching) in the last ten years, due to several factors: • rapid developments in consumer technologies such as smartphones that enable text, audio and video to be both created and transmitted by end users at low cost; • compression of digital media, enabling even high bandwidth video or television to be carried over wireless, landlines and the Internet at an economic cost (at least in economically advanced countries); • improvements in media software, making it relatively easy for non-professional users to create and distribute all kinds of media; • increasing amounts of media-based open educational resources, which are already developed learning materials that are free for teachers and students alike to use. The good news then is that in general, and in principle, cost should no longer be an automatic discriminator in the choice of media.Ifyouarehappytoacceptthisstatement atfacevalue,thanyou can skip the rest of this chapter. Choose the mix of media that best meets your teaching needs, and don’t worry about which medium is likely to cost more. Indeed, a good case could be made that it wouldnowbecheapertoreplaceface-to-faceteachingwithpurelyonlinelearning,ifcostwastheonly consideration. Inpracticehowevercostscanvaryenormouslybothbetweenandwithinmedia,dependingonceagain oncontextanddesign.Sincethemaincostfromateacher’sperspectiveistheirtime,itisimportantto knowwhatarethe‘drivers’ofcost,thatis,whatfactorsareassociatedwithincreasedcosts,depending on the context and the medium being used. These factors are less influenced by new technological developments, and can therefore be seen as ‘foundational’ principles when considering the costs of educational media. Unfortunately there aremany different factorsthat can influence the actual costofusingmedia in education,whichmakesadetaileddiscussionofcostsverycomplex(foramoredetailedtreatment,see BatesandSangrà, 2011).As aresult,Iwilltry toidentifythemain costdrivers,thenprovide atable thatprovides asimplifiedguide tohowthesefactorsinfluencethe costsofdifferentmedia,including face-to-faceteaching.Thisguideagainshouldbeconsideredasaheuristicdevice,soseethissectionas Media Costs 101. 9.4.2Cost categories Themaincostcategoriestobeconsideredinusingeducationalmediaandtechnologies,andespecially blended or online learning, are as follows: 9.4.2.1 Development These are the costs needed to pull together or create learning materials using particular media or technologies. There are several sub-categories of development costs: • production costs: making a video or building a course section in a learning management system, or creating a virtual world. Included in these costs will be the time of specialist staff, such as web designers or media or computer specialists, as well as any costs in web designorvideo production; • your time as an instructor: the work you have to do as part of developing or producing materials. This will include planning/course design as well as development. Your time is money, and probably the largestsingle cost in using educational technologies, but more importantly, if you are developing learning materials you are not doing other things, such as research or interacting with students, so there is a real cost, even if it is not expressed in dollar terms; • copyright clearance if you are using third party materials such as photos or video clips. Again, this is more likely to be thought of as time in finding and clearing copyright more than money; • probably the cost of aninstructional designer in terms of their time. Developmentcostsareusuallyfixed or‘onceonly’andareindependentofthenumberofstudents.Once mediaaredeveloped,theyareusuallyscalable,inthatonceproduced,theycanbeusedbyanynumber oflearnerswithoutincreaseddevelopment costs.Usingopeneducational resourcescangreatlyreduce media development costs. 9.4.2.2 Delivery Thisincludesthecostoftheeducationalactivitiesneededduringofferingthecourseandwouldinclude instructionaltime spent interacting with students, instructionaltime spent on marking assignments, andwouldincludethetimeofotherstaffsupportingdelivery,suchasteachingassistants,adjunctsfor additional sections and instructional designers and technical support staff. Becauseofthecostofhumanfactorssuchasinstructionaltimeandtechnicalsupportneededinmedia.basedteaching,deliverycoststendtoincreaseasstudentnumbersincrease,andalsohavetoberepeated eachtimethecourseisonoffer.Inotherwords,theyarerecurrent.However,increasinglywithInternet.based delivery, there is usually a zero directtechnology cost in delivery. 9.4.2.3Maintenance costs Once materials for a course are created, they need to be maintained. Urls go dead, set readings may gooutofprintorexpire,andmoreimportantlynewdevelopmentsinthesubjectareamayneedtobe accommodated. Thus once a course is offered, there are ongoing maintenance costs. Instructional designers and/or media professionals can manage some of the maintenance, but neverthelessteachersorinstructorswillneedtobeinvolvedwithdecisionsaboutcontentreplacement orupdating.Maintenanceisnotusuallyamajortimeconsumerforasinglecourse,butifaninstructor isinvolved in the design and production of several online courses, maintenance time can build to a significant amount. Maintenance costs are usually independent of the number of students, but are dependent on the number of courses an instructor is responsible for, and are recurrent each year. 9.4.2.4 Overheads These include infrastructure or overhead costs, such as the cost of licensing a learning management system,lecturecapturetechnologyandserversforvideostreaming.Thesearerealcostsbutnotonesthat canbeallocatedtoasinglecoursebutwillbesharedacrossanumberofcourses.Overheadsareusually considered to be institutional costs and, although important, probably will not influence a teacher’s decisionaboutwhichmediatouse,providedtheseservicesarealreadyinplaceandtheinstitutiondoes not directly charge for such services. However,ifanewonlineprogramistobeofferedonafullcost-recoverybasis,thenotherinstitutional overheadswillalsoneed tobeadded.Somewillbethesameasforon-campuscourses(forexample, acontributiontowardsthePresident’sOffice),butotheroverheadsappliedtoon-campusstudents,such asbuildingmaintenance,willnotapplytoafullyonlineprogram(whichisthemainreasonthatthenet cost of an online program is usually less than that of a campus-based program). 8.4.3 Cost drivers The primary factors that drive cost are: • the development/production of materials; • the delivery of materials; • number of students/scalability; • the experience of an instructor working with the medium; • whether the instructor develops materialsalone (self-development) or workswith professionals. Productionoftechnology-basedmaterialssuchasavideoprogram,oraWebsite,isafixedcost,inthatit isnotinfluencedbyhowmanystudentstakethecourse.However,productioncostscanvarydepending onthedesignofthecourse.Engle(2014)showedthatdependingonthemethodofvideoproduction,the developmentcostsforaMOOCcouldvarybyafactorofsix(themostexpensiveproductionmethod– full studio production – being six times that of an instructor self-recording on a laptop). Nevertheless, once produced, the cost is independent of the number of students. Thus the more expensivethecoursetodevelop,thegreatertheneedtoincreasestudentnumberstoreducetheaverage cost per student. (Orput another way, the greater the number of students, the more reason to ensure thathighqualityproductionisused,whateverthemedium).InthecaseofMOOCs(whichtend tobe almosttwiceasexpensivetodevelopasanonlinecourseforcreditusingalearningmanagementsystem – University of Ottawa, 2013) the number of learners is so great that the averagecost perstudent is verysmall.Thusthereareopportunitiesforeconomiesofscalefromthedevelopmentofdigitalmaterial, providedthatstudentcourseenrolmentscanbeincreased(whichmaynotalwaysbethecase).Thiscan be described as the potential for thescalability of a medium. Similarly, there are costs in teaching the course once the course is developed. These tend to be variable costs,inthattheyincreaseasclasssizeincreases.Ifstudent-teacherinteraction,throughonline discussionforumsandassignmentmarking,istobekepttoamanageablelevel,thentheteacher-student rationeedstobekeptrelativelylow(forinstance,between1:25to1:40,dependingonthesubjectarea andthelevelofthecourse).Themorestudents,themoretimeateacherwillneedtospendondelivery, oradditionalcontractinstructorswillneedtobehired.Eitherway,increasedstudentnumbersgenerally willleadtoincreasedcosts.MOOCsareanexception.Theirmainvaluepropositionisthattheydonot providedirectlearnersupport, sohavezerodeliverycosts.However, thisisprobablythe reasonwhy such a small proportionofparticipantssuccessfully complete MOOCs. Theremaybebenefitsthenfor ateacherorforaninstitutioninspending moremoneyupfrontfor interactivelearningmaterialsifthisleadstolessdemandforteacher-studentinteraction.Forinstance,a mathematicscoursemightbeabletouseautomatedtestingandfeedbackandsimulationsanddiagrams, andpre-designedanswerstofrequentlyaskedquestions,withlessorevennotimespentonindividual assignment marking or communication with the teacher. In this case it may be possible to manage teacher-student ratios as high as 1:200 or more, without significant loss of quality. Also,experienceinusingorworkingwithaparticularmediumordeliverymethodisalsoimportant. The first time an instructor uses a particular medium such as podcasting, it takes much longer than subsequentproductionsorofferings.Somemediaortechnologiesthoughneedmuchmoreefforttolearn tousethanothers.Thusarelatedcostdriveriswhethertheinstructorworksalone(self-development)or workswithmediaprofessionals.Self-developingmaterialswillusuallytakelongerforaninstructorthan working with professionals. Thereareadvantagesinteachersandinstructorsworkingwithmediaprofessionalswhendeveloping digital media. Media professionalswill ensure the development of a quality product, and above all cansave teachers or instructorsconsiderable time, for instance through the choice of appropriate software, editing, and storage and streaming of digital materials. Instructional designers can help in suggestingappropriateapplicationsofdifferentmediafordifferentlearningoutcomes.Thusaswithall educationaldesign,ateamapproachislikelytobemoreeffective,andworkingwithotherprofessionals willhelp control the time teachers and instructors spend on media development. Lastly, design decisions are critical. Costs are driven by design decisions within a medium. For instancecostdriversaredifferentbetweenlecturesandseminars(orlabclasses)inface-to-faceteaching. Similarly,videocanbeusedjusttorecordtalkingheads,asinlecturecapture,orcanbeusedtoexploit theaffordancesofthemedium(seeChapter8),suchasdemonstratingprocesses orlocationshooting.

Otherreadersmay well rate the cells differently. Figure 9.4.3 Cost drivers for educational media Although the time it takes to develop and deliver learning using different technologies islikely to influenceaninstructor’sdecisionaboutwhattechnologytouse,itisnotasimpleequation.Forinstance, developingagoodqualityonlinecourseusingamixofvideoandtextmaterialsmaytakemuchmoreof theinstructor’stimetopreparethanifthecoursewasofferedthroughclassroomteaching.However,the onlinecoursemaytakelesstimeindeliveryoverseveralyears,becausestudentsmaybespendingmore timeontaskonline,andlesstimeindirectinteractionwiththeinstructor.Onceagain,weseethatdesign is a critical factor in how costs are assessed. Inshort,from aninstructorperspective,timeisthecritical costfactor.

For instructors, the main cost will be their time. However it is important to look at time over the length of a course over several years, not just in the initial production or preparation of materials.

From all his research over many years, Mayer identified 12 principles of multimedia design, based on how learnerscognitively process multimedia: 9.5.1.1Coherence People learn better when extraneous words, pictures and sounds are excluded rather than included. Basically, keep it simple in media terms. 9.5.1.2Signalling People learn better when cues that highlight the organization of the essential material are added. This replicatesearlier findingsbyBatesandGallagher(1977).Studentsneed toknowwhat tolookforin multimedia materials. 9.5.1.3 [Avoid] Redundancy People learn better from graphics + narration, than from graphics, narration and on-screen text. 9.5.1.4Spatial contiguity People learn better when corresponding words and pictures are presented near rather than far from each other on the page or screen 9.5.1.5 Temporal contiguity People learn better when corresponding words and pictures are presented simultaneously rather than successively. 9.5.1.6Segmenting People learn better when a multimedia lesson is presented in user-paced segments rather than as a continuous lesson. Thusseveral‘YouTube’lengthvideosaremorelikelytoworkbetterthana50minute video. 9.5.1.7 Pre-training People learn better from a multimedia lesson when they know the names and the characteristics of the main concepts. Thissuggests adesignfeatureforflippedclassrooms,forinstance.Itmaybebetter to usealectureorreadingsthatprovideasummaryofkeyconceptsandprinciplesbeforeshowingmore detailed examples or applications of such principles in a video. 9.5.1.8Modality People learn better from graphics and narration than from animation and on-screen text. Thisreflects theimportanceoflearnersbeingabletocombinebothhearingandviewingatthesametimetoreinforce each other in specific ways. 9.5.1.9Multimedia People learn better from words and pictures than from words alone. ThisalsoreinforceswhatIwrotein 1995:Make all four media available to teachers and learners (Bates,1995, p.13). 9.5.1.10 Personalization People learn better from multimedia lessons when words are in conversational style rather than formal style. I would go even further than Mayer here. Multimedia can enable learners (particularly distancelearners)torelatetotheinstructor,assuggestedbyDurbridge’sresearch(1983,1984)onaudio combinedwith text.Providinga‘humanvoiceandface’ totheteachinghelpsmotivatelearners,and makesmultimediateachingfeelthatitisdirectedsolelyattheindividuallearner,ifaconversationalstyle is adopted. 9.5.1.11 Voice People learn better when the narration in multimedia lessons is spoken in a friendly human voice rather than a machine voice. 9.5.1.12 [No] image People do not necessarily learn better from a multimedia lesson when the speaker’s image is added to the screen. In re-reading Mayer’s work, I am struck by the similarities in findings, using different research methods, different multimedia technologies, and different contexts, to the research from the Audio-Visual Media Research Group at the British Open University in the 1970s and 1980s (Bates,1984). More recently, the University of British Columbia has done an excellent job of suggesting how Mayer’sdesign principles could be operationalised.Staff at the University of British Columbia have combined Mayer’s findings with Robert Talbert’s experiencefromdeveloping a series of successful screencasts on mathematics,into a set of practicaldesign guidelines for multimedia production. Talbert’s key design principles are: • keep it Simple: focus on one idea at a time. • keep it Short: keep videos to a length 5-6 minutes max. to maximize attention. • keep it Real: model the decision making and problem solving processes of expert learners. • keep it Good: be intentional about planning the video; strive to produce the best video and audio quality possible. Thus design decisions are critical in influencing the effectiveness of a particular technology. Well-designed lectures will teach better than a poorly designed online course, and vice versa. 9.5.2 Teaching as a weak discriminator in media selection Chapter 8 was exclusively focused on the best uses of each medium. Section 9.5.1 above then goes ontolookateffectivedesignofmultimedia.Mostteachersandinstructorswouldputtheeffectiveness of a medium for teaching and learning as the first criterion for media selection. If the technology is noteducationallyeffective,whywouldyouuseit?WhydoweneedtheotherpartsoftheSECTIONS model? However, if a student cannot access or use atechnology, there will be no learning from that technology, no matter how useful the educational affordances or how well the medium is designed.Furthermore,motivatedteacherswillovercomeeducationalweaknessesorshortcomingsina particulartechnology,orconverselyteachersinexperiencedinusingmediawilloftenunder-exploitthe potential of a medium (such as using video for talking heads). Similarly,studentswillresponddifferentlytodifferenttechnologiesduetopreferredlearningstyles ordifferencesinmotivation.Studentswhoworkhardcanovercomepooruseoflearningtechnologies.It isnotsurprisingthenthatwithsomanyvariablesinvolved,teachingandlearningisarelativelyweak discriminatorforselectingandusingtechnologies.Access(andeaseofuse)arestrongerdiscriminators thanteachingeffectivenessinselectingmedia.Thisexplainswhyteachingthatdoesnotreallyexploit theeducationalaffordancesofamediumcanoftenstillgetgoodresults.Nevertheless,ideallyoneshould trytomakebestuseofthepedagogicalfeaturesofamediumbecausewhenitisthencombinedwiththe other SECTIONS criteria, the teaching is likely to be more effective. 9.5.3 Questions for consideration Therefore,itisnotenoughtofocusjustonthedesignofmultimediamaterials,asimportantasdesign is, even considering just the pedagogical context. The choice and use of medianeed to be related to otherfactors(whatMayercalls‘boundaryconditions’),suchasindividualdifferencesbetweenlearners, thecomplexityofthecontent,andthedesiredlearningoutcomes.Thuswhenconsideringmediafroma strictly teaching perspective, the following questions need to be considered: 1. Who are my students? 2. What content needs to be covered? 3. What are the desired learning outcomes from the teaching in terms of skills development? 4. What instructional strategies or approaches to learningdo I plan using? 5. What are the unique pedagogical characteristics of different media? How might different media help with the presentation of content and development of student skills in this course? 6. What is the best way to present the content to be covered in this course? How can media help with the presentation of content? Which media for what content? 7. What skills am I trying to develop on this course? How can media helpstudents with the development of the requisite skills for this course? Which media for which skills? 8. Whatprinciples do I need to use when designing multimedia materials for their most effective use? Workingthroughthesequestionsislikelytobeaniterativeratherthanasequentialprocess.Depending on the way you prefer to think about and make decisions, it may help to write down the answers to eachofthequestions,butgoingthroughtheprocessofthinkingaboutthesequestionsisprobablymore important,leavingyouwiththefreedomtomakechoicesonamoreintuitivebasis,havingfirsttakenall these – and other – factors into consideration. References Bates, A.

Types of learner interaction There are threedifferent ways learners can interact when studying (Moore, 1989), and each of these ways requires a somewhat different mix of media and technology. 9.6.1.1 Interaction with learning materials Thisistheinteractiongeneratedwhenstudentsworkonaparticularmedium,suchasaprintedtextbook, alearningmanagementsystem,orashortvideoclip,withoutdirectinterventionfromaninstructoror otherstudents.Thisinteractioncanbe‘reflective’,withoutanyovertactions,oritcanbe‘observable’, intheformof anassessedresponse,such asamultiplechoicetest, orasnotestoassistmemoryand comprehension. Computer technology can greatly facilitate learners’interaction with learning resources. Self-administered online tests can provide feedback to students on their comprehension or coverage of a subject area. Such tests can also provide feedback to teachers on topic areas where students are having difficulty, and can also be used for gradingof students on their comprehension. Using standard test software built into learning management systems, students can be automatically assessed and graded on their comprehension of course materials.More advanced activities might include composing music using software that converts musical notation to audio, entering data to test concepts through online simulations, or participating in games or decision-making scenarios controlled by the computer.Thuscomputer-managed learner interaction is particularly good for developing comprehension and understanding of concepts and procedures, but it has limitations in developing the higher order learning skills of analysis, synthesis and critical thinking, without additional human intervention of some kind. There are other waysbesides computer-managed learning to facilitate interaction between learners and learning material. Textbooks may include activities set by the author (as in this textbook), or instructorscansetstudentactivitiesaroundsetreadings.Otherstudentactivitiesmightincludereading textorwatchingvideosembeddedinalearningmanagementsystem,conductingastructuredapproach tofindingandanalyzing web-basedmaterials, ordownloadingandediting information fromtheweb tocreatee-portfoliosofwork.Theseactivitiesmayormaynotbeassessed,althoughevidencesuggests that students, and in particular students studying online, tend to focus more an assessed activities. Inotherwords,withgooddesignandadequateresources,technology-basedinstructioncanprovide high levels of student interaction with the learning materials. There are strong economic advantages inexploitingthepossibilitiesoflearners’interactionwithlearningmaterials,becauseintensestudent.interactionwithlearningresourcesincreasesthetimestudentsspendonlearning(‘time-on-task’),which tends to leadtoincreased learning (seeMeans etal.,2010).Perhaps moreimportantly, suchactivity, when well designed,can reduce the time the teacher needs to spend on interacting with each student. 9.6.1.2 Interaction between students and teacher Figure 9.6.2 Student-teacher interaction Image: © Joseph Mehling, DartmouthLife, 2007 Student-teacher interaction is often needed though in order to develop many of the higher order learningoutcomes,suchasanalysis,synthesis,andcriticalthinking.Thisisparticularlyimportantfor developing academic learning, where students are challenged to question ideas, and to acquire deep understanding.Thisoftenrequiresdialogueandconversation,eitherone-on-onebetweeninstructorand students,orbetweenaninstructorandagroupofstudents.Theroleoftheteacherinforinstanceeither face-to-face seminars or online collaborative learning is therefore critical. Sometechnologies,suchasonlinediscussionforums,enableorencouragesuchdialogueordiscourse betweenstudentsandinstructorsatadistance.Themainlimitationofstudent-teacherinteractionisthat it can be time-demanding for the teacher, and therefore does not scale easily. 9.6.1.3 Student – student interaction Figure 9.6.3 A student directed seminar at UBC Image: © University of British Columbia, 2014 Highqualitystudent-studentinteractioncanbeprovidedequallywellbothinface-to-faceandonline learningcontexts.Asynchronousonlinediscussionforumsbuiltintolearningmanagementsystemscan enablethiskindofinteraction.ConnectivistMOOCsandcommunitiesofpracticealsoenablestudent.student interaction. Againthoughqualitydependsongooddesign.Merelyputtingstudentstogetherinagroup,whether onlineorface-to-face,isnotlikelytoleadtoeitherhighlevelsofparticipationorhighqualitylearning withoutcarefulthoughtbeinggiventotheeducationalgoalsofdiscussionwithinacourse,thetopicsfor discussionandtheirrelationshiptoassessmentandlearningoutcomes,andwithoutstrongpreparationof the students bythe instructor for self-directed discussions (seeChapter 4, Section 4,for more on this.) Inatechnologicallyrichlearningenvironment,then,akeydecisionforateacherorcoursedesigner is choosing the best mix of these three different kinds of interaction, taking into considerationthe epistemologicalapproach,theamountoftimeavailableforbothstudentsandinstructor,andthedesired learning outcomes. Technology can enable all three kinds of interaction. 9.6.2 The interactive characteristics of mediaand technologies Differenttechnologiescanenhanceorinhibiteachofthethreetypesofinteractivityoutlinedabove.This againmeanslookingatthedimensionofinteractivity asitapplies todifferentmediaandtechnology. This dimension has three components or points on the dimension in terms oftheextent an active response from a user is required when a medium or technology is used for teaching. 9.6.2.1 Inherent interactivity Some media are inherently ‘active’ in that they ‘push’ learners to respond. An example is adaptive learning,wherestudentscannotprogresstothenextstageoflearningwithoutinteractingthroughatest thatascertainswhethertheyhavelearnedsufficientlytoprogresstothenextstage,orwhat‘corrective’ learningtheystillneedtodo.Behaviouristcomputer-basedlearningisinherentlyinteractive,asitforces learnerstorespond.Technologiesthatcontrolhow alearnerresponds areoftenassociatedwith more behaviourist approaches to teaching and learning. 9.6.2.2 Designed interactivity Althoughsomemediaortechnologiesarenotinherentlyinteractive,theycanbeexplicitlydesignedto encourageinteractionwithlearners.Forinstance,althoughawebpageis notinherentlyinteractive,it canbedesignedtobeinteractive,byaddingacommentboxorbyrequiringuserstoenterinformation ormakechoices.Inparticular, teachersorinstructorscanaddorsuggestactivitieswithin aparticular medium.Apodcastcanbedesignedsothatstudentsstopthepodcasteveryfewminutestodoanactivity based on the content of the podcast. This approach can be applied just as much to textbooks, where activities can be included, as to web pages. Inmanycases,though,amediumwillrequiretheinterventionofateacherorinstructorboth toset activitiesaroundthelearningmaterialsandtoprovideappropriatefeedback,thusaddingtoratherthan reducingtheworkloadofinstructors.Thuswhereinstructorshavetointerveneeithertodesignactivities ortoprovidefeedback,the costortimedemands ontheinstructor arelikelytobegreaterthanifthe other two kinds of interaction are used. 9.6.2.3 User-generated interaction Somemediamaynothaveexplicitinteractionbuiltin,butendusersmaystillvoluntarilyinteractwith themedium,eithercognitivelyand/orthroughsomephysicalresponse.Forinstancesomeoneinanart gallerymaycognitivelyoremotionallyrespondtoaparticularpainting(whileothersmayjustglanceat itorpassitby).Studentsmaychoose tomakesketches ordrawingsfromthepainting.Learnersmay respond in similar ways toreading a novel or poem. Thecreatorsoftheworkmayinfactdeliberatelydesigntheworktoencouragereflectionoranalysis, butnotinexplicitways,leavingtheinterpretationofaworktotheviewerorreader.(Thisofcourseis aconstructivistapproachtolearning.)Mediathatencouragelearnersindependentlytobeactivewithout thenecessaryinterventionofateacherorinstructoralsohavecostadvantages,althoughthequalityof the interaction willbe more difficult to monitor or assess. 9.6.2.4 Who’s in control? Thusonedimensionofinteractivityiscontrol:towhatextentisinteractioncontrolledorenabledbythe technology, bythecreators/instructors, orbytheusers/learners?It canbeseenthatthisis acomplex dimension, once again influenced by epistemological positions, and also by design decisions on the teacher’s part.Thesecategoriesofinteractivity areinno way‘fixed’,withdifferentlevels ortypesof interactionpossiblewithinthe samemediumortechnology.Intheend,interactionneeds tobelinked to desired learning outcomes. What kind of interaction will best lead to a particular type of learning outcome, and what technology or medium best provides this kind of interaction? 9.6.3 Interaction and feedback Feedbackisanimportantaspectofinteraction,andtimelyandappropriatefeedbackonlearneractivities is often essential for effectivelearning. In particular, to what extent is feedback possible within a particularmedium?Althoughforinstancealearnermayrespondactivelytoapoeminabook,feedback onthatinteractionisusually notavailablejustfromthereading.Someothermediumwillneed tobe used to provide that feedback, such as a face-to-face poetryclass or an online discussion forum. On the other hand, with computer-based learning, once a student has responded to a multiple-choice question, the computer can mark the question and give almost instant feedback.However, withsometechnologiessuchasprint,providingappropriateorimmediatefeedbacktolearnersontheir activitiesmaybedifficult orimpossible.Although‘model’ or‘correct’answersmightbeprovidedin atextonanotherpage,qualityfeedbackonactivitiesmustbeprovidedbyateacherorinstructorwhen using a printed medium. Thus media and technologies again differ in their capacity to provide variouskinds of feedback. From a teaching perspective, it is important to be clear about what kind of feedback is likely to be most effective, and then the most effective way to providethat feedback. In particular, under what circumstances is it appropriate to automate feedback, and when should feedback be provided by a teacher/instructor, or perhaps a teaching assistant, or even by other students? 9.6.4 Analysingthe interactive qualities of different media In Figure 9.6.4 I have analysed the interactive qualities of different educational media along two differentdimensions:differenttypesofstudentinteraction;andcharacteristicsofthemedium,interms of whether interaction is built into the medium, or needs to be added through deliberate design, or whether it is left to the learner to decide how to interact. Figure 9.6.4 Media and student interaction Ihaveallocatedanumberofdifferentmediahereaccordingtothetypeoflearneractivitytheyhelp generate.Theactuallocationthoughofsomeofthesemediawillbedependentondesigndecisionsmade by the instructor. For instance, a podcast could be accompanied by an activity (designed), or just be astraight broadcast,withthestudentleft tointerpretits meaningand purposeinthe course(learner.generated). Insomecases,anactivitymaybetriggeredbyonemedium(suchasapodcast)buttheactual activity and the feedback maytake placein another medium (such as through an online assessment). 9.6.5Summary Thus it canbe seenthatmedia andtechnology aresomewhat slipperywhen it comestocategorising theminterms ofinteraction,becauseinstructorsandlearnersoftenhave achoiceinhowthemedium willactuallybeused,andthatwillaffecthowlearnerinteractionandfeedbacktakesplacewithinasingle medium.Thusonceagainthequalityofthedesignoftheinteractiveexperiencesisasimportantasthe mediumofchoiceforenablingtheactivity,althoughaninappropriatechoiceoftechnologycanreduce thelevelofactivityand/orthequalityoftheinteractions.Inrealityteachersandlearnersarelikelytouse acombinationofmediaandtechnologiestoensurehighqualityinteractivity.However,usinganumber of different mediais likely to increase cost and workload forboth instructors and learners. Onceagain,thereisnoevaluativejudgementonmypartintermsofwhichmediaorcharacteristics providethe‘best’interactivity.Thechoiceofmediumshoulddependonthekindofactivitiesthatare judgedimportantby ateacherorinstructorwithintheoverall contextoftheteaching.Thepurposeof thisanalysisistosensitizeyoutothedifferencesbetweeneducationalmediaingeneratingorfacilitating differenttypesofinteractivity,sothatyoucanmakeinformeddecisions.Inthiscase,though,thereare noclearmediaortechnology‘winners’intermsofinteractivity.Designdecisionsarelikelytobemore important than technology choice. Nevertheless, technology can enable students separated from their instructorsstilltogetqualityactivitiesandfeedback,andwhenappropriatelyused,technologyusedto support activities can result in more time on task for students. 9.6.6 Questions for consideration 1. In terms of the skills I am trying to develop, what kinds of interaction will be most useful? What media or technology could I use to facilitate that kind of interaction? 2. In terms of the effective use of my time, what kinds of interaction will produce a good balance between on the one hand student comprehension and student skills development, and on the other the amount of time I will be interacting personallyor online with students? 1. Go to YouTube and type in your subject area into the ‘search’ box. 2. Choose a YouTube video from the list that comes up that you might recommend to your students to watch. 3. What kind of interaction wouldthe YouTube video require from yourstudents? Does it force them to respond in some way (inherent)? 4. In what way are they likely to respond to the YouTube on their own,e.g. make notes, do an activity, think about the topic (learner-generated)? 5. What activity could you suggest that they do, after they have watched the YouTubevideo(designed)? What type of knowledge or skill would that activity help develop? What medium or technology would students use to do the activity? 6. How would students get feedback on theactivity that you set? What medium or technology would they and/or you use for gettingand giving feedback on their activity? 7. How much work for you would that activity cause? Would the workbe both manageable and worthwhile? Could the activitybe scaled for larger numbers of students? 8. How could the YouTube video have been designed to generate more or better activity from viewersorstudents? Thereisnofeedbackfrommeforthisactivity,whichrequiresuser-generatedactivity(thatis,youhaveto do the work!) Reference Means,B.etal.(2009)Evaluation of Evidence-Based Practices in Online Learning: A Meta-Analysis and Review of Online Learning Studies Washington, DC: US Department of Education Moore, M.G. (1989)Three types of interactionAmerican Journal of Distance Education, Vol.3, No.2 9.7Organisational issues 9.7.1Institutional readiness for teaching with technology One of the critical issues that will influence the selection of media byteachers and instructors is: • the way the institution structures teaching activities; • the instructional and technology services already in place; • the support for media and technology use that their institution provides. 501 Ifaninstitutionisorganisedaroundasetnumberofclassroomperiodseveryday,andtheuseofphysical classrooms,theteachersarelikelytofocusmainlyonclassroomdelivery.AsMackenziewasquotedin Chapter 9 Section 1: ‘Teachers have always made the best of whatever they’ve got at hand, but it’s what we have to work with. Teachers make due.’ The reverse is equally true. If the school or university does not support a particular technology, teachersandinstructorsquiteunderstandablywon’tuseit.Evenifthetechnologyisinplace,suchasa learningmanagementsystemoravideoproductionfacility,ifinstructorsarenottrainedororientedtoits useandpotential,thenitwilleitherbeunderusedornotusedatall.Furthermore,if‘core’technologies’ suchaslearningmanagementsystems orlecture capturefacilities arenotproperlymanaged orifthe services are understaffed, teachers and instructors lose patience and confidence in the technology. Because of the inertia in institutions,there is often a bias towards those technologies that can be introducedwiththeminimumoforganisationalchange,althoughthesemaynotbethetechnologiesthat wouldhavemaximumimpactonlearning.Theseorganisationalchallengesareextremelydifficult,and areoftenmajorreasonsfortheslowimplementationofnewtechnologiesforteachingineducation(see Marshall,2009) for a method for assessing the readiness of institutions for online learning). Most institutions that have successfully introduced media and technology for teaching on a large scalehaverecognizedtheneedforadequateprofessionalsupportforfaculty,byprovidinginstructional designers,mediadesignersandITsupportstafftosupportteachingandlearning.Someinstitutionsalso provide funding for innovative teaching projects. 9.7.2Work with professionals Figure 8.7.2 Chris Crowley is an Instructional Designer/Project Manager for UBC’s Centre for Teaching, Learning and Technology. He is involved in the design, development and delivery of online courses and learning resources in a number of subject areas including Soil Science. Even those experienced in using media for teaching and learningwould be wise to work with instructionaldesignersandprofessionalmediaproducerswhencreatinganyofthemediadiscussedin thischapter(withthepossibleexceptionofsocialmedia).Itisimportantforthechoiceoftechnologyto be driven by educational goals, rather than starting with a particular medium or technology in mind. There are several reasons for working with professionals: • they understand the technology and as a result will enable you to develop a better product more quickly than working alone; • two heads are better than one:working collaboratively will result in new and better ideas about how you could be using the medium; • instructional designers and professional media producers will usually be familiar with project management and budgeting for media production, enabling resources to be developed in time and on budget. This is important as it is easy for teachers or instructors to get sucked into spending far more time than necessary on producing media. Thekeypointhereisthatalthoughitisnowpossibleforteachersandinstructorstoproducereasonably goodqualityaudioandvideoontheirown,theywillalwaysbenefitfromtheinputofprofessionalsin media production. 9.7.3Questions for consideration 1. How much and what kind of help can I get from the institution in choosing and using media for teaching? Is helpeasily accessible? How good is the help? Do thesupport peoplehave the media professionalism I will need? Are they up to date in the use of new technologies for teaching? 2. Is there possible funding available to ‘buy me out’ for a semester and/or to fund a teaching assistant so I can concentrate on designing a new course or revising an existing course? Is there funding for media production? 3. To what extent will I have to follow ‘standard’ technologies, practices and procedures, such as using a learning management system, orlecture capture system, or will I be encouraged and supported to try something new? 4. Are there already suitable media resources freely available that I can use in my teaching, rather than creating everything from scratch? Can I get help from the library for instance in identifying these resources and dealing with any copyright issues (seeChapter 11, Section 2)? If the answers are negativefor each of these questions, you would be wise to set very modest goals initially for using media and technology. Nevertheless the good news is that it is increasingly easy to create and manage your own media such as web sites, blogs, wikis, podcasts and simple video production using a desktop computer or evenamobilephone.Furthermorestudentsthemselvesareoftencapableandinterestedinparticipating or helping with creating learning resources, if given the chance. Getting students involved in media productionisaverygoodwayforthemtogetadeeperunderstandingofasubject.Aboveall,thereis anincreasing amount ofreally goodeducational mediacomingavailable forfree useforeducational purposes, as we shall see in Chapter 11, so it is not necessary always to create media from scratch. References Bates,A.andSangrà,A.(2011)Managing Technology in Higher Education SanFrancisco:Jossey-Bass Marshall, S.

The LMS, which is password protected and available only to the instructor and other enrolled students, allows for ‘safe’ communication within the course. The use of social media allows for connections with the external world(contributions canstillbescreenedbythe courseblogorwikiadministratorbymonitoringand approvingcontributions.) Forinstance,acourseonMiddleEasternpoliticscouldhaveaninternaldiscussionforumfocusedon relatingcurrenteventsdirectlytothethemesandissuesthatarethefocusofthecourse,butstudentsmay managetheirown,publicwikithatencouragescontributionsfromMiddleEastscholarsandstudents, andindeed anyone from the general public.

However, the issues previously raised underspeedhavealsobeenincludedinSECTIONS‘EaseofUse’(Chapter9,Section2).Thisallows ‘Speed’tobereplacedwith‘Securityandprivacy’,issueswhichhavebecomeincreasinglyimportant for educationin a digital age. 9.9.1The need for privacy and security when teaching Teachers, instructors and students need a private place to work online. Instructors want to be able to criticize politicians or corporations without fear of reprisal; students may want to keep rash or radicalcommentsfromgoingpublicorwillwanttotryoutperhapscontroversialideaswithouthaving themspreadall overFacebook.Institutions wanttoprotectstudentsfrompersonaldatacollectionfor commercialpurposesbyprivatecompanies,trackingoftheironlinelearningactivitiesbygovernment 511 agencies, ormarketing and other unrequested commercial or political interruption totheir studies. In particular,institutionswanttoprotectstudents,asfaraspossible,fromonlineharassmentorbullying. Creating a strictly controlled environment enables institutions to manage privacy and security more effectively. Learning management systems provide password protected access to registered students and authorisedinstructors.Learningmanagementsystemswereoriginallyhousedonserversmanagedbythe institutionitself.PasswordprotectedLMSsonsecureservershaveprovidedthatprotection.Institutional policiesregardingappropriateonlinebehaviourcanbemanagedmoreeasilyifthecommunicationsare managed ‘in-house.’ 9.9.2Cloud based services and privacy However,inrecentyears,moreandmoreonlineserviceshavemoved‘tothecloud’,hostedonmassive servers whose physical location is often unknown even to the institution’s IT services department. Contract agreements between an educational institution and the cloud service provider are meant to ensure security and back-ups. Nevertheless,Canadianinstitutionsandprivacycommissionershavebeenparticularlywaryofdata beinghostedoutofcountry,whereitmaybeaccessedthroughthelawsofanothercountry.Therehas beenconcernthatCanadianstudentinformationandcommunicationsheldoncloudserversintheUSA may be accessible via the U.S. Patriot Act. For instance, Klassen (2015) writes: Social media companies are almost exclusively based in the United States, where the provisions of the Patriot Act apply no matter where the information originates. The Patriot Act allows the U.S. government to access the social media content and the personally identifying information without the end users’ knowledge or consent. The government of British Columbia, concerned with both the privacy and security of personal information, enacted a stringent piece of legislation to protect the personal information of British Columbians. The Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA) mandates that no personally identifying information of British Columbians can be collected without their knowledge and consent, and that such information not be used for anything other than the purpose for which it was originally collected. Concerns about student privacy have increased even more when it became known that countries weresharingintelligenceinformation,sothereremainsariskthatevenstudentdataonCanadian-based servers may well be shared with foreign countries. Perhaps of more concern though is that as instructors and students increasingly use social media, academic communicationbecomes public and ‘exposed’.Bishop (2011) discusses the risks to institutions in using Facebook: • privacy is different from security, in that security is primarily a technical, hence mainly an IT, issue. Privacy needs a different set of policies that involves a much wider range of stakeholders within an institution, and hence a different (and more complex) governance approach from security; • many institutions do not have a simple, transparent set of policies for privacy, but different policies set by different parts of the institution. This will inevitably lead to confusion and difficulties in compliance; • there is a whole range of laws and regulations that aim to protect privacy;these cover not only students but also staff; privacy policy needs to be consistent across the institution and be compliant with such laws and regulation; • Facebook’s current privacy policy (2011) leaves many institutions using Facebook at a high level of risk of infringing or violating privacy laws – merely writing some kind of disclaimer will in many cases not be sufficient to avoid breaking the law. ThecontroversyatDalhousieUniversitywheredentalstudentsusedFacebookforviolentsexistremarks about their fellow women students is an example of the risks endemic in the use of social media. 9.9.3The need for balance Althoughtheremaywellbesomeareasofteachingandlearningwhereitisessentialtooperatebehind closeddoors,suchasinsomeareasofmedicineorareasrelatedtopublicsecurity,orindiscussionof sensitivepoliticalormoralissues,ingeneralthoughtherehavebeenrelativelyfewprivacyorsecurity problems when teachers and instructors have opened up their courses, have followed institutional privacypolicies,andaboveallwherestudentsandinstructorshaveused commonsenseandbehaved ethically.Nevertheless,asteachingandlearningbecomesmoreopenandpublic,thelevelofriskdoes increase. 9.9.4 Questions for consideration 1.WhatstudentinformationamIobligedtokeepprivateandsecure?Whataremyinstitution’spolicies on this? 2.Whatistheriskthatbyusingaparticulartechnologymyinstitution’spoliciesconcerningprivacy could easily be breached?

Tony. I’m very excited about your model. We could take itand apply it in every school and university in the world. Tony. Really? Now how would you do that? Pierre. Well, you have a set of questions that teachers have to ask for each of the criteria. There is probably a limited set of answers to these questions. You could either work out what those answers are, or collect answers from a representative sample of teachers. Youcould then give scores to each technology depending on the answers they give. So when a teacher has to make a choice of technology, they would sit down, answer the questions, then depending on their answers, the computer would calculate the best choice of technology. Voilà! Tony. I don’t think that’s going to work, Pierre. Pierre: But why not? Tony. I’m not sure, but I have a gut feeling about this. Pierre. A gut feeling? My English is not so good. What do you mean by a gut feeling? Tony. Pierre, your English is excellent. My response is not entirely logical, so let me try and think it throughnow, both for you and me, why I don’t think this will work. First, I’m not sure there is a limited number of possible answers to each question, but even if there is, it’s not going to work. Pierre. Well, why not? Tony. Because I’m not sure how a teacher would score their response to each question and in any case there’s going to be interaction between the the answers to the questions. It’s not the addition of each answerthat will determine what technology they might use, but how those answers combine. From a computing point of view, there could be very many different combinations of answers, and I’m not sure what the significant combinations are likely to be with regard to choosing each technology. Pierre. But we have very big and fast computers, and we can simplify the process through algorithms. Tony. Yes, but you have to take into account the context in which teachers will make media selections. They are going to be making decisions about mediaall the time, in many different contexts. It’s just not practical to sit down at a computer, answer all the questions, then wait for the computer’s recommendation. Pierre. But won’t you give this a try? We can work through all these problems. Tony. Pierre, I really appreciate your suggestion, but my gut tells me this won’t work, and I really don’t want to waste your time or mine on this. Pierre. Well, what are you going to tell teachers then? How will they make their decisions? Tony. I will tell them to use their gut instinct, Pierre – when they have read and applied the ACTIONS model. Thisreallyisatruestory,althoughtheactualwordsspokenmayhavebeendifferent.Thefactthatwe dohaveartificialintelligencethesedaysthattechnicallycoulddothishasn’tchangedmymind,because whatwehaveinthisscenarioisaconflictbetweendeductivereasoning(Pierre)andinductivereasoning (Tony). 9.10.1.1 Deductive reasoning Withdeductivereasoning,youwoulddowhatPierresuggests:startwithoutanypriorconceptionsabout whichtechnologytouse,answereachofthequestionsIposedattheendofeachpartoftheSECTIONS model,thenwritedownallthepossibletechnologiesthatwouldfitthe answerstoeachquestion, see what technology would best match each of the questions/criteria, and ‘score’ each technology on a recommendedscaleforeachcriterion.Youwouldthentrytofindawaytoaddallthoseanswerstogether, perhaps by using a very large matrix, and then end up with a decision about what technology to use. Amajorproblemthoughisthateveryteacherandeverylearningcontextissomewhatdifferenteach timeadecisionneedstobemade.Experiencedteachersinparticularwillbringawholelotofknowledge withthem –ideasabouteffectiveteachingmethods,knowledgeofthestudents,therequirementofthe contentandtheskillstheyaretryingtodevelopatthemomentofdecision,andaboveallthecontextin which the medium will be used (home, classroom, etc.) – before they have to make a decision. 9.10.1.2 Inductive reasoning MysolutionisverydifferentfromPierre’s.Mineisamoreinductiveapproachtodecisionmaking.The main criterion for inductive logic is as follows: As evidence accumulates, the degree to which the collection of true evidence statements comes to support a hypothesis, as measured by the logic, should tend to indicate that false hypotheses are probably false and that true hypotheses are probably true. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Intermsofselecting media,you probably start with anumberof possible technologies in mind at thebeginningoftheprocess(hypotheses–oryourgutfeeling).Mysuggestedprocessisstartwithyour gutfeelingaboutwhichtechnologiesyou’rethinkingofusing,butkeeping anopenmind,then move throughallthequestionssuggestedineachoftheSECTIONScriteria(thatis,collectingevidencefor oragainstyourinitial‘gutfeeling’.)Youthenstartbuildingmoreevidencetosupportorrejecttheuse ofaparticularmediumortechnology.Bytheendoftheprocessyouhavea‘probabilistic’viewofwhat combinationsofmediawillworkbestforyouandwhy.Thisisnotanexerciseyouwouldhavetodoin detailorevenconsciouslyeverytime.Onceyouhavedoneitjustafewtimes,thechoiceofmediumor technologyineach‘new’situationwillbequickerandeasier,becausethebrainstoresalltheprevious informationandyouhave aframework(theSECTIONSmodel)for organising newinformationasit arrives and integrating it with your previous knowledge. 9.10.1.3Rapid decision-making Nowyou’vereadthischapteryoualreadyhaveasetofquestionsforconsideration(Ihavelistedthemall togetherinAppendix1foreasyreference).Youarenowinthesamepositionasthekingwhoaskedthe alchemisthowtomakegold.‘It’seasy’,saidthealchemist,‘solongasyoudon’tthinkaboutelephants.’ Well,havingreadthethreechaptersonmediainfull,younowhavetheelephantsinyourhead.Itwill bedifficulttoignorethem.Thebrainisinfactawonderfulinstrumentformakingintuitiveorinductive decisionsofthiskind.Thetrickthoughistohaveallthisinformationsomewhereinyourhead,soyou canpullitalloutwhenyouneedit.Thebraindoesthisveryquickly.Yourdecisionswon’talwaysbe perfect,buttheywillbealotbetterthanifyouhadn’talreadythoughtaboutalltheseissues,andinlife, rough but ready usually beats perfect but late. 9.10.2 Grounding media selection within a course development framework Mediaselectiondoesnothappeninavacuum.Therearemanyotherfactorstoconsiderwhendesigning teaching.

In the absence of good theory, I have suggested four factors to consider when deciding on mode of delivery, and in particular the different uses of face-to-face and online learning in blended courses: • student characteristics and needs; • your preferred teaching strategy, in terms of methods and learning outcomes; • the pedagogical and presentational requirements of the subject matter, in terms of (a) content and (b)skills; • the resources available to you as an instructor (including yourtime). 4.The movetoblendedorhybridlearninginparticular meansrethinkingthe useofthecampusandthe facilities needed fully to support learning in a hybrid mode. 10.1The continuum of technology-based learning Figure 10.1.1 Why get on the bus when you can study online? (UBC bus loop) In Chapters 7, 8 and 9, the use of media incorporated into a particular course or program was explored. In this chapter, the focus is on deciding whether a whole course or program should be offered partly or wholly online. In Chapter 11 the focus ison deciding whenand how toadopt an approach that incorporates ‘open-ness’ in its design and delivery. 10.1.1 The many faces of online learning Onlinelearning,blendedlearning,flippedlearning,hybridlearning,flexiblelearning,openlearningand distanceeducationarealltermsthatareoftenusedinter-changeably,buttherearesignificantdifferences in meaning.Moreimportantly, these formsofeducation, onceconsidered somewhat esoteric and out 523 of the mainstream of conventional education, are increasingly taking on greater significance and in some cases becoming mainstream themselves.As teachers and instructors become more familiar and confidentwithonlinelearningandnewtechnologies,therewillbemoreinnovationinintegratingonline and face-to-face teaching. 10.1.1.1Variations on blended learning At the time of writing though it is possible to identify at least the following modes of delivery: • classroom teaching with no technology at all (which is very rare these days); • blended learning, which encompasses a wide variety of designs, including: . technology-enhanced learning, or technology used as classroom aids;a typical example would be the use of Powerpoint slides and/or clickers in a lecture; . the use ofa learning management system to support classroom teaching, for storing learning materials, providing a course schedule of topics, for online discussion, and for submitting student assignments, but teaching is still delivered mainly through classroom sessions; . the use oflecture capture for flipped classrooms, where students watch the lecture via streamed video then come to class for discussion or other work;see for instance a calculus courseoffered at Queen’s University, Canada; . one semester face-to-face on campus and two semesters online (one model atRoyal Roads University); . hybrid orflexible learningrequiring the redesign of teachingso that students can do the majority of their learning online, coming to campus only for very specific face.to-face teaching, such as lab or hands-on practical work, that cannot be done satisfactorily online (for examples, see Section 10.1.1.2 below); • fully online learning with no classroom or on-campus teaching, which is one form of distance education, including: . courses for credit, which will usually cover the same content, skills and assessment as acampus-based version, but are available only to students admitted to a program; . non-credit courses offered only online, such as courses for continuing professional education; . fully open courses, such as MOOCs. MorethanonethirdofhighereducationstudentsintheUSAnowtakeatleastonefullyonlinecourse, andabout15per centofstudents aretakingonlyonline courses.WhileoverallenrolmentsintheUS higher education system have slowly declined (by almost 4 per cent between 2012 to 2016), online enrolmentshavegrownbyabout5per centoverthesameperiod(Seaman etal.,2018).InCanadian post-secondaryinstitutionsin2017,approximately8percentofallcreditcourseregistrationswerefully online (Donovan et. al.,2018). 10.1.1.2Hybrid learning Thereisanimportantdevelopmentwithinblendedlearningthatdeservesspecialmention,andthatisthe totalre-designofcampus-basedclassesthattakesgreateradvantageofthepotentialoftechnology,which Icallhybrid learning, withonlinelearningcombinedwithfocusedsmallgroupface-to-faceinteractions ormixingonlineandphysicallabexperiences.Insuchdesigns,theamountofface-to-facecontacttime isusuallyreduced,forinstancefromthreeclassesaweektoone,toallowmoretimeforstudentstostudy online. Inhybridlearningthewholelearningexperienceisre-designed,withatransformationofteachingon campus built around the use of technology. For instance: • Carol Twigg at theNational Center for Academic Transformationhas for many yearsworked withuniversities and colleges toredesign usually large lecture class programs to improve learning and reduce costs through the use of technology. This program ran very successfully between 1999 and 2018; • Virginia Tech many years ago created asuccessful program for first and second year math teachingbuilt around 24 x 7 computer-assisted learning supported by ‘roving’ instructors and teaching assistants (Robinson and Moore,2006); • The University of British Columbia launched in 2013 what it callsa flexible learninginitiativefocusedondeveloping, delivering, and evaluating learning experiences that promote effective and dramatic improvements in student achievement. Flexible learning enables pedagogical and logistical flexibility so that students have more choice in their learning opportunities, including when, where, and what they want to learn. Thus‘blendedlearning’ canmeanminimalrethinking orredesignofclassroomteaching,such asthe use of classroom aids, or complete redesign as in flexibly designed courses, which aim to identify theuniquepedagogicalcharacteristicsofface-to-faceteaching,withonlinelearningprovidingflexible access forthe rest of the learning. Instructors in more than three quarters of Canadian post-secondary institutions in 2017 were integratingonlinewithclassroomteaching,but nomorethanoneinfiveinstitutionshad asignificant numberof coursesinthisformat.However, mostinstitutionsare predictingarapidincreaseinsuch courses over the next few years (Donovan et al.,2019) 10.1.2The continuum of online learning Thus there is a continuum of technology-based learning, as illustrated in Figure 10.1.2 above. 10.1.3Decisions, decisions! Thesedevelopmentsopenupawholenewrangeofdecisionsforinstructors.Everyinstructornowneeds to decide: • what kind ofcourse or programshould Ibe offering? • what factors should influence this decision? • what is the role of classroom teaching when students can now increasingly study most things online? • should I open up my teaching to anyone, and if so, under what circumstances? This chapter aims to help you answer these questions. References Bates,A.andPoole,G.(2003)Effective Teaching with Technology in Higher Education: Foundations for Success San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Donovan, T. et al.

Many surveys have foundthat a majority of faculty still believe that online learning or distance educationisinevitablyinferiorinqualitytoclassroomteaching(seeforinstanceJaschikandLetterman, 2014).Infact,thereisnoscientifically-basedevidencetosupportthisopinion.Theevidencepointsin generaltonosignificantdifferences,andifanythingresearchsuggeststhatblendedorhybridlearning hassome advantages over face-to-face teaching in terms of learning performance (see, for example, Means et al.,2010). 9.2.1The influence of distance education on online learning Wecanlearnagreatdealfromearlierdevelopmentsindistanceeducation.Althoughthetechnologyis different, fully online learning is, after all, just another version of distance education. Muchhasbeenwrittenaboutdistanceeducation(see,forinstance,Wedemeyer,1981;Peters,1983; Holmberg, 1989; Keegan, 1990; Moore and Kearsley, 1996; Peters, 2002; Bates, 2005; Evans et al., 2008)butinconcept,theideaisquitesimple:studentsstudyintheirowntime,attheplaceoftheirchoice (home,workorlearningcentre),andwithoutface-to-facecontactwithateacher.However,studentsare ‘connected’,todayusuallythroughtheInternet,withaninstructor,adjunctfacultyortutorwhoprovides learner support and student assessment. Distance education has been around a very long time. It could be argued that in the Christian religion,St.Paul’sepistletotheCorinthianswasanearlyformofdistanceeducation(53-57AD).The first distance education degree was offered by correspondence by the University of London (UK) in 1858.Studentsweremailedalistofreadings,andtookthesameexaminationastheregularon-campus students.Ifstudentscouldaffordit,theyhiredaprivatetutor,buttheVictoriannovelistCharlesDickens calleditthePeople’s University,becauseitprovided accesstohighereducation tostudentsfromless affluentbackgrounds.Theprogramstillcontinuestothisday,butisnowcalledtheUniversityofLondon (Worldwide),with more than 50,000 students in 180 countries. 529 In North America,historically many of the initial land-grant universities, such as Penn State University,theUniversityofWisconsin,andtheUniversityofNewMexicointheUSA,andMemorial University, UniversityofSaskatchewanandtheUniversityofBritishColumbiainCanada,hadstate.orprovince-wideresponsibilities.Asaresulttheseinstitutionshavealonghistoryofofferingdistance education programs, mainly as continuing education for farmers, teachers, andhealth professionalsscatteredacrossthewholestateorprovince.Theseprogramshavenowbeenexpandedto coverundergraduateandprofessionalmastersstudents.Australiaisanothercountrywith anextensive history of both k-12 and post-secondary distance education. Qualificationsreceivedfrommostoftheseuniversitiescarrythesamerecognitionasdegreestakenon campus.Forinstance,theUniversityofBritishColumbia,whichhasbeenofferingdistanceeducation programssince1936,makes nodistinctiononstudenttranscriptsbetween coursestakenatadistance and those taken on campus, as both kinds of students take the same examinations. Anotherfeatureofdistanceeducation,pioneeredbytheBritishOpenUniversityinthe1970s,butlater adoptedandadaptedbyNorthAmerican universitiesthatoffereddistanceprograms,isacoursedesign process,basedontheADDIEmodel,butspeciallyadaptedtoservestudentslearningatadistance.This placesaheavyemphasisondefinedlearningoutcomes,productionofhighqualitymultimedialearning materials,plannedstudentactivitiesandengagement,andstronglearnersupport,evenatadistance.As aresult,campus-baseduniversitiesthatoffereddistanceeducationprograms werewellplacedforthe moveintoonlinelearninginthe1990s.Theseuniversitieshavefoundthatingeneral,studentstaking theonlineprogramsdoalmostaswellastheon-campusstudents(coursecompletionratesareusually within5-10percentoftheon-campusstudents–seeOntario,2011),whichissomewhatsurprisingas the distance students often have full-time jobs and families. It is important to acknowledgethe long and distinguished pedigree of distance education from internationally recognised, high quality institutions, because commercial diploma mills, especially in the USA, have given distance education an unjustified reputation of being of lower quality. As with all teaching, distance education can be done well or badly. However, where distance education has beenprofessionallydesignedanddeliveredbyhighqualitypublicinstitutions,ithasprovedtobevery successful,meetingtheneedsofmanyworkingadults,studentsinremoteareaswhowouldotherwisebe unabletoaccesseducationonafull-timebasis,oron-campusstudentswantingtofitinanextracourseor withpart-timejobswhosescheduleclasheswiththeirlectureschedule.However,universities,colleges and even schools havebeen able to do this only by meeting high quality design standards. Atthesametime,therehasalsobeenasmallbutveryinfluentialnumberofcampus-basedteachers andinstructorswhoquiteindependentlyofdistanceeducationhavebeendevelopingbestpracticesin online or computer-supported learning.These include Roxanne Hiltz and Murray Turoff (1978) who wereexperimentingwithonlineorblendedlearningasearlyasthelate1970sattheNewJerseyInstitute ofTechnology,andLindaHarasim(2017)atSimonFraserUniversity,whoallfocusedparticularlyon online collaborative learning and knowledge construction within a campus or school environment. There is also plenty of evidence that teachers and instructors in many schools, colleges and universities new to online learning have not adopted these best practices, instead merely transferring lecture-based classroom practice toblended and online learning, often with poor or even disastrous results. 10.2.2What the research tells us Therehavebeenthousandsofstudiescomparingface-to-faceteaching toteachingwith awiderange ofdifferenttechnologies, such astelevisedlectures,computer-basedlearning, andonlinelearning, or comparingface-to-faceteachingwithdistanceeducation.Withregardtoonlinelearningtherehavebeen several meta-studies.A meta-studycombines the results of many ‘well-conductedscientific’ studies, usually studies that use the matched comparisons or quasi-experimental method(Means et al., 2010; Barnard et al., 2014). Nearly all such ‘well-conducted’ meta-studies find no or little significant differencebetweenthemodesofdelivery,intermsoftheeffectonstudentlearningorperformance.For instance,Meansetal.(2010),inamajormeta-analysisofresearchonblendedandonlinelearningfor the U.S. Department of Education, reported: In recent experimental and quasi-experimental studies contrasting blends of online and face-to-face instruction with conventional face-to-face classes, blended instruction has been more effective, providing a rationale for the effort required to design and implement blended approaches.

Tamim et al. found there is a slight tendency for studentswhostudywithtechnologytodobetterthanstudentswhostudywithouttechnology.However, the measured difference was quite weak, and theauthorsstate: it is arguable that it is aspects of the goals of instruction, pedagogy, teacher effectiveness, subject matter, age level, fidelity of technology implementation, and possibly other factors that may represent more powerful influences on effect sizes than the nature of the technology intervention. Researchintoanykindoflearningisnoteasy;therearejustsomanydifferentvariablesorconditions that affect learning in any context.

Student needs Figure 10.3.1 Who are your students? Image: UBC Library When making choices about mode of delivery, teachers and instructors need to ask the following fourquestions: • who are– or could be – my students? • what is my preferred teaching approach? • what are the content and skills that I need to teach? • what resources will I have to support my decision? As always, start with the learners. 535 10.3.1 Fully online/distance learners Research (see for instanceDabbagh, 2007)has repeatedly shown that fully online courses suit some types of student better than others: • older, more mature students; • students with already high levels of education; • part-time students who are working and/or with families. This applies not onlyto MOOCs (see Chapter 5) and other non-credit courses, but even more so to courses and programs for credit. There are in fact several different markets for online learning. 10.3.1.1 Undergraduate online students Today, ‘distance’is morelikely to be psychological or social, rather than geographical. For instance, from survey data regularly collected from students at the University of British Columbia (UBC): • less than 20 per cent givereasons related todistance or travel for taking an online course; • mostof the more than 10,000 or so UBC students (there are over 60,000 students in total) taking at least one fully onlinecourse are not truly distant. The majority (over 80 per cent) live in the Greater Vancouver Metropolitan Area, within 90 minutes commute time to the university, and almost half within the relatively compact City of Vancouver. Comparativelyfew(less than 10 per cent)live outside the province(although this proportion is slowlygrowing each year); • two thirds of UBC’s onlinestudents have paid work of one kind or another; • many undergraduate students in their fourth year take an online course because the face-to.face classes are ‘capped’ because of their large size, or because they are short of the required number of credits to complete a degree.Taking a course online allows these students to complete their program without having to come back for another year; • the main reason for most UBC students taking fully onlinecourses is the flexibility they provide, given the work and family commitments of students and the difficulty caused by timetable conflicts for face-to-face classes. IntheUSA,almostoneinthreeundergraduatestudentsaretakingatleastoneonlinecourse(Allenand Seaman,2017).Atanundergraduatelevel,studentsarelikelytotakeamaximumofthreetofouronline coursesaspartofaregularcampus-baseddegreeprogramatuniversitiesanduptofiveonlinecoursesat two year colleges, in Canada (Donovan et al.,2018). Until recently in North America, there were few undergraduate programs offered entirely online, exceptinspecialistinstitutionssuch astheopenuniversitiesinCanada(Athabasca,Téluq,Thompson Rivers Open Learning) and University of Phoenix, Western Governors University, and University of Maryland University College in the USA. However, in recent years a number of specialist online undergraduate programs have started to be offered, such as the Bachelor of Mining Engineering Technologyfor working miners at Queen’s University, Canada Thissuggeststhatfullyonlinecoursesaremoresuitableformoreexperiencedstudentswithastrong motivationtotakesuchcoursesbecauseoftheimpacttheyhaveontheirqualityoflife.Ingeneral,online studentsneedmoreself-disciplineinstudyingandagreatermotivationtostudytosucceed.Thisdoes notmeanthatotherkindsofstudentscannotbenefitfromonlinelearning,butextraeffortneedstogo into the design and support of such students online. 10.3.1.2 Graduate online students AlthoughintheUSA,theproportionofstudentstakingdistanceeducationcoursesatagraduatelevel overallisalmostthesame(17percent)asthosetakingon-campusgraduatecourses–15percent,the proportionofstudentstakingdistanceeducationcoursesatagraduatelevelismuchhigherforprivate, not-forprofit–37percent,andfor-profitinstitutions–28percent(AllenandSeaman,2017).(Asin Canada–Donovan.etal.,2018–distanceeducationnowisalmostsynonymouswithonlinelearningin the USA). The most rapid area of growth in online courses is for masters programs aimed at working professionals.Sofar,apartfromMBAsandteachereducation,publicuniversitiestendtoberelatively slow in recognising the importance of this market, which at worse could be self-financing, and at best couldbring in muchneeded additional revenues. Thefor-profit universities, though,such asthe UniversityofPhoenix,LaureateUniversityandCapellaUniversity,andespeciallysomeoftheprivate, not-for-profit universities in the USA have been quicker to move into this market. 10.3.1.3Remote learners Oftenitisalsoassumedthatisolatedorremotelearnersarethemainmarketfordistanceorfullyonline learners in that they are a long way away from any local school, college or university. Certainly in Canada,therearesuchstudentsandtheabilitytostudylocallyratherthantravelgreatdistancescanbe veryappealing.However,inmanyremoteruralareas,Internetaccesscanbedifficult,witheitherslow satelliteconnectionsortelephone-based,slow-speedmodems.Remotelearnerswillalsostruggleifthere is no easily accessible or culturally appropriate local support for their studies. Sincethe vastmajorityofonlinelearners areurban,livingwithin onehour’s travelof acollegeor university campus, it is the flexibility rather than the distance that matters to these learners. 10.3.1.4Lifelong learners Ontheotherhand,fullyonlinecoursesreallysuitworkingprofessionals.Inadigitalage,theknowledge base is continually expanding, jobs change rapidly, and hence there is strong demand for on-going, continuingeducation,oftenin‘niche’areasofknowledge.Onlinelearningisaconvenientandeffective way of providing such lifelong learning. Lifelonglearnersareoftenworkingwithfamiliesandreallyappreciatetheflexibilityofstudyingfully online. They often already have higher education qualifications such as a first degree, and therefore have learnedhow tostudysuccessfully. They may beengineers looking fortrainingin management, orprofessionalswantingtokeepuptodateintheirprofessionalarea.Theyareoftenbettermotivated, becausetheycanseeadirectlinkbetweenthenewcourseofstudyandpossibleimprovementintheir careerprospects.Theyarethereforeidealstudentsforonline courses(eventhoughtheymaybeolder and less tech savvy than students coming out of high school). Whatisimportantforsuchlearnersisthatthecoursesaretechnicallywelldesigned,inthatlearners do not need to be highly skilled in using computers to be able to study the courses. 10.3.1.5 Changing demographics One other factor to consider isthe impact of changing demographics.In the USA, overall higher educationenrolmentsdeclinedby3percentbetween2012-2015,whiledistanceeducationenrolments increased by 4 per cent over the same period (Allen and Seaman,2017). Injurisdictionswheretheschool-agepopulationisstartingtodecline,expandingintolifelonglearning marketsmaybeessentialformaintainingstudentenrolments.Althoughtherateofgrowthindistance education/online learning is not spectacular, it may eventually turn out to be a way to keep some academic departments alive. 10.3.1.6New business models However, tomakelifelonglearningonlineprogramswork,institutionsneed tomakesomeimportant adjustments.Inparticulartheremustbeincentivesorrewardsforfacultytomoveinthisdirectionand there needs to be some strategic thinking about the best way to offer such programs. The University of British Columbiahas developed a series of very successful, fully online, self.financingprofessionalmasters’programs.StudentscaninitiallytryoneortwocoursesintheGraduate CertificateinRehabilitationbeforeapplyingtothemaster’sprogram.Thecertificatecanbecompleted inlessthantwoyearswhileworkingfull-time,andpayingpercourseratherthanforawholeMaster’s year,providingtheflexibilityneededbylifelonglearners.UBCalsopartneredwithTecdeMonterreyin Mexico,withthesameprogrambeingofferedinEnglishbyUBCandinSpanishbyTecdeMonterrey, asameansofkick-startingitsverysuccessfulMasterinEducationalTechnologyprogram,which,when itopened,doubledthenumberofgraduatestudentsinUBC’sFacultyofEducation,andisstillrunning now almost 20 years after its initial offering.We shall see these examples are important when we examine the development of modular programming inSection 11.5.2. Onlinelearningalsoofferstheopportunitytoofferprogramswhereaninstitutionhasuniqueresearch expertisebutinsufficientlocalstudentstoofferafullmaster’sprogram.Bygoingfullyonline,perhaps in partnership with another university with similar expertise but in a different jurisdiction, it may be abletoattractstudentsfromacrossthecountryoreveninternationally,enablingtheresearchtobemore widelydisseminatedandtobuildacadreofprofessionalsinnewlyemergingareasofknowledge–again an important goal in a digital age. 10.3.2Blended learning learners In terms of blended learning, the ‘market’ is less clearly defined than for fully online learning. The benefit for students is increased flexibility, but they will still need to be relatively local in order to attend the campus-based sessions. The main advantage is for the 50 per cent or more ofstudents, at least inCanada,who areworkingmorethan15hours aweek(Marshall, 2010)tohelpwiththe cost oftheireducationandtokeeptheirstudentdebtaslowaspossible.Also,blendedlearningprovidesan opportunityforthegradualdevelopmentofindependentlearningskills,aslongasthisisanintentional teaching strategy. The research also suggests that these skills of independent learning need to be developed while students are on campus. In other words, online learning, in the form of blended learning, should be deliberatelyintroducedandgraduallyincreasedasstudentsworkthroughaprogram,sobythetimethey graduate,theyhavetheskillstocontinuetolearnindependently–acriticalskillforthedigitalage.In general,itis notagoodidea toofferfullyonline coursesintheearlyyearsof auniversityorcollege career,unlesstheyareexceptionallywelldesignedwithaconsiderableamountofonlinelearnersupport –and hence are likely to be expensive to mount, if they are to be successful. As well as the benefits of more flexibility for students, especially those working part-time, the academicbenefitsofblendedlearningarebeingbetterunderstood.Thesewillbediscussedinmoredetail inthenextsection.Atthispoint,thereisevidencethatinCanada,atleast,moreandmoreinstitutions areseeingamovebyinstructorstoblendedorhybridlearning,providingtheadvantagesofbothonline and face-to-face teaching (Donovan et al., 2018) 10.3.3Face-to-face learners Many students coming straight from high school will be looking forsocial, sporting and cultural opportunities that a campus-based education provides. Also students lacking self-confidence or experienceinstudyingarelikelytopreferface-to-faceteaching,providingthattheycanaccessitina relatively personal way. However, the academic reasons for preference for face-to-face teaching by freshmen and women arelessclear,particularlyifstudentsarefacedwithverylargeclassesandrelativelylittlecontactwith professorsinthefirstyearorsooftheirprograms.Inthisrespect,smaller,regionalinstitutions,which generallyhavesmallerclassesandmoreface-to-facecontactwithinstructors,haveanadvantage.Also, blended or flipped learning is increasingly being used for very large classes, with lectures available online, and smaller groups meeting face-to-face with an instructor or teaching assistants. Weshallseelaterinthischapterthatblendedandfullyonlinelearningoffertheopportunitytore-think thewholecampusexperiencesothatbettersupportisprovidedtoon-campuslearnersintheirearlyyears inpost-secondaryeducation.Moreimportantly,asmoreandmorestudyingisdoneonline,universities andcollegeswillbeincreasinglychallengedtoidentifytheuniquepedagogicaladvantagesofcomingto campus, so that it will still beworthwhile for students to get on the bus to campus every morning. 10.3.4 Know your learners Itisthereforeveryimportanttoknowwhatkindofstudentsyouwillbeteaching.Forsomestudents,it willbebettertoenrolinaface-to-faceclassbutbegraduallyintroducedtoonlinestudywithinafamiliar classroomenvironment.Forotherstudents,theonlywaytheywilltakethecoursewillbeifitisavailable fullyonline.Itisalsopossibletomixandmatchface-to-faceandonlinelearningforsomestudentswho wantthecampusexperience,butalsoneedacertainamountofflexibilityintheirstudying.Goingonline mayenableyoutoreachawidermarket(criticalfordepartmentswithlowordecliningenrolments)or tomeetstrongdemandfromworkingprofessionals.Whoare(orcouldbe)yourstudents?Whatkindof course will work best for them? Weshallseethatidentifyingthelikelystudentmarketforacourseorprogramisthestrongestfactor in deciding on mode of delivery. References Allen,I.andSeaman,J.(2017)DigitalLearningCompass:DistanceEducationEnrollmentReport2017 Babson Survey Research Group/eLiterate/WCET Dabbagh,N.(2007)Theonlinelearner:characteristicsandpedagogicalimplicationsContemporary Issues in Technology and Teacher Education, Vol. 7, No.3 Donovan, T. et al.

Thechallenge was to decide what wasbest done in print, on television, via home experiment kits, and finally in a one week residential hands-on summer school at a traditional university. Since then,Dietmar Kennepohl and Lawton Shaw, of Athabasca University, have edited an excellent book about teaching science online (Kennepohl and Shaw, 2010). Also, the ColoradoCommunity College System has recently been using a combination of remotely operated labs for student practical work, combined with home kits, for teaching online introductory science courses (Schmidt and Shea,2015). Each of these initiatives has adopted a pragmatic method for making decisions about what must be done face-to-face and what can be done online. What each of these approaches had in common waistrustingtheknowledgeandexperienceofsubjectexpertswhoarewillingtoapproachthisquestion in an open-minded way, and working with instructional designers or media producerson an equal footing. Fromtheseexperiences,Ihaveextractedonepossibleprocessfordeterminingwhentogoonlineand whennotto,onpurelypedagogicalgrounds,foracoursethatisbeingdesignedfromscratchinablended delivery mode.It is based on a five step process: 1. identify the overall instructional approach/pedagogy required 2. identify the main content to be covered 3. identify the main skills to be taught 4. analyse the resources available 5. analyse the most appropriate mode of delivery for each of the learning objectives identified above Iwillchooseasubjectareaatrandom:haematology(thestudyofblood),inwhichIamnotanexpert. But here’s what I would suggest if I was working with a subject specialist in this area. 10.4.1.2Step 1: identify the main instructional approach. This is discussed in some detail in Chapters 2to4, but here are the kinds of decision to be considered: Figure 10.4.3 Which teaching approach? Thisshouldleadtoageneralplanorapproachtoteachingthatidentifiestheteachingmethodstobe usedinsomedetail.Intheexampleofhaematology,theinstructorwantstotakeamoreconstructivist approach,withstudentsdevelopingacriticalapproachtothesubjectmatter.Inparticular,shewantsto relatethecoursespecificallytocertainissues,suchassecurityinhandlingandstoringblood,factorsin blood contamination, and developing student skills in analysis and interpretation of blood samples. 10.4.1.3Step 2.Identify the main content to be covered Content covers facts, data, hypotheses, ideas, arguments, evidence, and description of things (for instance,showingordescribingthepartsofapieceofequipmentandtheirrelationship).Whatdothey needtoknowinthiscourse?Inhaematology, thiswill meanunderstandingthechemicalcomposition ofblood,whatitsfunctionsare,howitcirculatesthroughthebody,descriptionsoftherelevantpartsof cellbiology,whatexternalfactorsmayweakenitsintegrityorfunctionality,andsoforth,theequipment usedtoanalysebloodandhowtheequipmentworks,principles,theoriesandhypothesesaboutblood clotting, the relationship between blood tests and diseases or other illnesses, and so on. In particular, what are the presentational requirements of the content in this course? Dynamic activitiesneedtobeexplained,andrepresentingkeyconceptsincolourwillalmostcertainlybevaluable. Observations of blood samples under many degrees of magnitudewill be essential, which will requirethe use of a microscope. There are now many ways to represent content: text, graphics, audio, video and simulations. For instance, graphics, a short video clip, or photographs down a microscope can show examples of bloodcellsindifferentconditions.Increasinglythis contentisalreadyavailable overthewebforfree educationaluse(forinstance,seetheAmericanSocietyofHematology’svideolibrary).Creatingsuch materialfromscratchismoreexpensive,butisbecomingincreasinglyeasytodowithhighquality,low costdigitalrecordingequipment.Usingacarefullyrecordedvideoofanexperimentwilloftenprovidea better view than students will get crowding around awkward lab equipment. 10.4.1.4Step 3. Identify the main skills to be developed during the course Skills describehowcontentwillbeappliedandpracticed.Thismightincludeanalysisofthecomponents ofblood,suchastheglucoseandinsulinlevels,theuseofequipment(whereabilitytouseequipment safely and effectively is a desired learning outcome), diagnosis, interpreting results by making hypotheses about cause and effect based on theory and evidence, problem-solving, and report writing. Developing skills online can be more of a challenge, particularly if it requires manipulation of equipmentanda‘feel’forhowequipmentworks,orsimilarskillsthatrequiretactilesense.(Thesame couldbesaidofskillsthatrequire tasteorsmell).Inourhematologyexample,someoftheskillsthat needtobetaughtmightincludetheabilitytoanalyseanalytesorparticularcomponentsofblood,suchas insulinorglucose,tointerpretresults,andtosuggesttreatment.Theaimherewouldbetoseeifthereare waystheseskillscanalsobetaughteffectivelyonline.Thiswouldmeanidentifyingtheskillsneeded, workingouthowtodevelopsuchskills(includingopportunitiesforpractice)online,andhowtoassess such skills online. Let’s call Steps 2 and 3the key learning objectives for the course. 10.4.1.5Step 4: Analyse the most appropriate mode for each learning objective Then create a table as in Figure 10.4.4: Figure 10.4.4 Allocating mode of delivery Inthisexample,theinstructoriskeentomoveasmuchaspossibleonline,soshecanspendasmuch timeaspossiblewithstudents,dealingwithlaboratoryworkandansweringquestionsabouttheoryand practice.Shewasabletofindsomeexcellentonlinevideosofseveralofthekeyinteractionsbetween bloodandotherfactors,andshewasalsoabletofindsomesuitablegraphicsandsimpleanimationsof themolecularstructureofbloodwhichshecouldadapt,aswellascreatingwiththehelpofagraphics designerherowngraphics.Indeed,shefoundshehadtocreaterelativelylittlenewmaterialorcontent herself. The instructional designer also found some software that enabled students to design their own laboratory set-up for certain elements of blood testing which involved combining virtual equipment, enteringdatavaluesandrunninganexperiment. However,therewerestillsomeskillsthatneededtobe donehands-oninthelaboratory,suchasinsertingglucoseandusinga‘real’microscopetoanalysethe chemicalcomponentsofblood.However,theonlinematerialenabledtheinstructortospendmoretime in the lab with students. It can be seen in this example that most of the content can be delivered online, together with a critically important skill of designing an experiment, but some activities still need to be done ‘hands.on’. This might require one or more evening or weekend sessions in a lab for hands-on work, thus delivering most of the course online, or there may be so much hands-on work that the course may have to be a hybrid of 50per centhands-on lab work and 50 per cent online learning. With the development of animations, simulations and online remote labs, where actual equipment can be remotely manipulated, it is becoming increasingly possible to move even traditional lab work online. At the same time, it is not always possible to find exactly what one needs online, although this will improve over time. In other subject areas such as humanities, social sciences, and business, it is much easier to move the teaching online. Thisisacrudemethodofdeterminingthebalancebetweenface-to-faceteachingandonlinelearning for a blended learning course, but it least it’s a start.It can be seen that these decisions have to be relatively intuitive, based on instructors’ knowledge of the subject area and their ability to think creativelyabouthowtoachievelearningoutcomesonline.However,wehaveenoughexperiencenow ofteachingonline toknowthatin mostsubjectareas, agreatdealoftheskillsand contentneededto achievequalitylearningoutcomescanbetaughtonline.Itisnolongerpossibletoarguethatthedefault decision must always be to do the teaching in a face-to-face manner. Thus every instructor now needs to ask the question: if I can move most of my teaching online, what are the unique benefits of the campus experience that I need to bring into my face-to-face teaching? Why do students have to be here in front of me, and when they are here, am I using the time to best advantage? 10.4.2 Analyse the resources available Thereisonemoreconsiderationbesidesthetypeoflearners,theoverallteachingmethod,andmaking decisionsbased onpedagogicalgrounds,andthatis toconsiderthe resourcesavailable.(Thisshould reallybeStep4,beforeallocatinglearningobjectivestodifferentmodes,butitwillbedifficulttoavoid in any case.). 10.4.2.1The time of the instructor Inparticular, thekey resourceisthetimeoftheteacher orinstructor.

There may be a minority of students who left high school directly for work, or went to a two year college to get vocational training, but now find they need a degree.

Image: © Cambridge Advanced Studies Program, Cambridge University, U.K., 2015 As more and more teaching is moved online, even for campus-based students, it will become increasinglyimportant to think about the function of face-to-face teaching and the use of space on campus. 10.5.1 Identifying the unique characteristics of face-to-face teaching in a digital world Sanjay Sarma, Director of MIT’s Office of Digital Learning, made an attempt at MIT’s LINC 2013 conference to identify the difference between campus-based and online learning, and in particular MOOCs.HemadethedistinctionbetweenMOOCsasopencoursesavailabletoanyone,reflectingthe highest levelofknowledgeinparticular subject areas,andthe ‘magic’ of theon-campus experience, which he claimed is distinctly different from the online experience (Sarma,2013). Hearguedthatitisdifficulttodefineorpindownthemagicthattakesplaceon-campus,butreferred to: • ‘in-the-corridor’ conversations between faculty and staff; • hands-on engineering with other students outside of lectures and scheduled labs; • the informal learning that takes place between students in close proximity to one another. 551 There are a couple of other characteristics that Sarma hinted at but did not mention explicitly in his presentation: • the very high standard of the students admitted to MIT, who ‘push’ each other to even higher standards; • the importance of the social networks developed by students at MIT that provide opportunities later in life. Easy and frequent access to laboratories is a serious contender for the uniqueness of campus-based learning,asthisisdifficulttoprovideonline,althoughthereisanincreasingnumberofdevelopments inremotelabsandtheuseofsimulations.Opportunitiesforfindingfuturespousesisanothercontender. Probably the most important though is access to social contacts that can further your career (see my podcast feedback onActivity 10.2for more on the ‘unique affordances’ of campus-based teaching.). Ileaveittoyoutojudgewhethertheseareuniquefeaturesofface-to-faceteaching,orwhetherthekey advantagesofacampusexperiencearemorespecifictoexpensiveandhighlyselectiveeliteinstitutions. Formostteachersandinstructors,though,moreconcreteandmoregeneralpedagogicaladvantagesfor face-to-face teaching need to be identified. 10.5.2 The lawof equal substitution In the meantime, we should start from the assumption that from a strictly pedagogical perspective, most courses can be taught equally well online or face-to-face,whatIcallthelawofequal substitution.Thismeansthatotherfactors,suchascost,convenienceforteachers,socialnetworking,the skillsandknowledgeoftheinstructor,thetypeofstudents,orthecontextofthecampus,willbestronger determinantsofwhethertoteachacourseonlineoroncampusthantheacademicdemandsofthesubject matter.

We need to turn the question on its head: what is the academic or pedagogical justification for the campus, when students can learn most things online? 10.5.3 The impact of online learning on the campus experience Thisquestionbecomesparticularlyimportantwhenweexaminehowanincreasedmovetoblendedor hybridlearningisgoingtoimpactonlearningspaces.Insomeways,thismayturnouttobeaticking time bomb for schools,colleges and universities. 10.5.3.1Rethinking the design of classrooms Aswemovefromlecturestomoreinteractivelearning,wewillneedtothinkaboutthespacesinwhich learningwilltakeplace,andhowpedagogy,onlinelearningandthedesignoflearningspacesinfluence oneanother. To make itworthwhile for students tocometo campus when they can do an increasing amount of their study online, the on-campus activities must be meaningful. If for instance we want students to come to campus for interpersonal communication and intense group work, will there be sufficientlyflexibleandwell-equippedspacesforstudentstodothis,rememberingthattheywillwant to combine their online work with their classroom activities? In essence, new technology, hybrid learning and the desireto engage students and to develop the knowledge and skills needed ina digital ageare leading some teachers and architectsto rethink the classroom and the way itis used. Figure 10.5.2 Design for an interactive classroom from Steelcase (© Steelcase, 2013) Steelcase,aleadingAmericanmanufacturerofofficeandeducationalfurniture,isnotonlyconducting impressive research into learning environments, but is way ahead of many of our post-secondary institutions in thinking through the implications of online learning for classroom design. Their educationalresearchwebsite,andtwooftheirreports:ActiveLearningSpacesandRethinkingSpace: SparkingCreativityaredocumentsthatallpost-secondaryinstitutionsandevenk-12plannersshouldbe looking at. In Active Learning Spaces, Steelcase reports: Formal learning spaces have remained the same for centuries: a rectangular box filled with rows of desks facing the instructor and writing board….As a result, today’s students and teachers suffer because these outmoded spaces inadequately support the integration of the three key elements of a successful learning environment: pedagogy, technology and space. Change begins with pedagogy. Teachers and teaching methods are diverse and evolving. From one class to the next, sometimes during the same class period, classrooms need change. Thus, they should fluidly adapt to different teaching and learning preferences. Instructors should be supported to develop new teaching strategies that support these new needs. Technology needs careful integration. Students today are digital natives, comfortable using technology to display, share and present information. Vertical surfaces to display content, multiple projection surfaces and whiteboards in various configurations are all important classroom considerations. Space impacts learning. More than three-quarters of classes include class discussions and nearly 60 percent of all classes include small group learning, and those percentages are continuing to grow. Interactive pedagogies require learning spaces where everyone can see the content and can see and interact with others. Every seat can and should be the best seat in the room. As more schools adopt constructivist pedagogies, the “sage on the stage” is giving way to the “guide on the side.” These spaces need to support the pedagogies and technology in the room to allow instructors who move among teams to provide real-time feedback, assessment, direction and support students in peer-to-peer learning. Pedagogy, technology and space, when carefully considered and integrated, define the new active learning ecosystem. In Rethinking Space: Sparking Creativity,Andrew Kim, Steelcase Education Researcher, states: Creative work is most effective in learning spaces that support team work flow and sharing of information. Thedesignofclassroomspacesnowneedstotakeintoaccountthatstudentsaredoinganincreasing amountoftheirworkonline(andoftenoutsidetheclassroom).Theclassroommustsupportopportunities for accessing, working on, sharing and demonstrating knowledge gained both within and outside the classroom.Thusiftheclassroomisorganizedinto‘clusters’offurnitureandequipmenttosupportsmall groupwork,theseclusterswillalsorequirepowersostudentscanplugintheirdevices,wirelessInternet access, and the ability to transmit work to shared screens around the room (in other words,a class Intranet).Studentsalsoneedquietplacesorbreakoutspaceswheretheycanworkindividuallyaswellas ingroups.Whenfacultyarepresentedwithsuchuseofspace,theynaturallyadoptmoreactivelearning approaches. 10.5.3.2 The impact of flipped classrooms and hybrid learning on classroom design These classrooms designs assumethat students are learning in relatively small classes. However, we are also seeing theredesign of large lecture classes usinghybrid designs such as flipped classrooms. IndeedMark Valenti (2013) of the Sextant Group (an audio-visual company)is reported as saying: ‘We’re basically seeing the beginning of the end of the lecture hall.’ Nevertheless,giventhecurrentfinancialcontext,weshouldnotassumethattheclassroomtimefor theseredesignedlargelecturesclasseswillbespentinsmallgroupsinindividualclassrooms(thereare probablynotenoughsmallclassroomstoaccommodatetheseclasseswhichoftenhaveoverathousand students).Largerspacesthatcanbeorganizedintosmallerworkinggroups,theneasilyreconvenedinto alarge,singlegroup,willbeneeded.Whatthespacefortheselargeclassescertainlyshouldnot beisthe raked rows of benches whichnow are now the norm in most large lecture theatres. Steelcase is also doing research on appropriate spaces for faculty. For instance, if a university or departmentisplanningalearningcommonsorcommonareaforstudents,whynotlocatefacultyoffices inthesamegeneralareainsteadofinaseparatebuilding?Indeed,acasecouldbemadeforintegrating faculty office space with more open teaching areas. 10.5.3.3The impact on capital building plans ItisobviouswhyacompanysuchasSteelcaseisinterestedinthesedevelopments.Thereisatremendous commercial opportunity for selling new and better forms of classroom furniture that meets these needs.However,thatistheproblem.Universities,collegesandespeciallyschoolssimplydonot have themoneytomovequicklytowardsnewclassroomdesigns,andeveniftheydid,theyshoulddosome careful thinking first about: • what kind of campus will be needed over the next 20 years, given the rapid moves to hybrid and online learning; • how much they need to invest in physical infrastructure when students can do much of their studies online. • where new campuses or major buildings are being built or renewed; • where large first and second year classes are being redesigned: maybe a prototype classroom design could be tried for one of these large lecture redesigns and tested; if successful the model could be added slowly to other large lecture classes; • where a department or program is being redesigned to integrate online learning and classroom teaching in a major way; they would receive priority for funding a new classroom design; • all major new purchases of classroom furniture to replace old or worn out equipment should first be subject to a review of classroom designs. Nevertheless, there areseveral opportunitiesfor atleastsettingprioritiesforinnovationinclassroom design: The important point here is that investment in new or adapted physical classroom space should be drivenbydecisionstochangepedagogy/teachingmethods.Thiswillmeanbringingtogetheracademics, IT support staff, instructional designers and staff from facilities, as well as architects and furniture suppliers.Second, as Winston Churchill said:‘we shape our buildings and afterwards our buildings shape us.’ Providing teachers and instructors with a flexible, well-designed learning environment is likelytoencouragemajorchangesintheirteaching;stuffingthemintorectangularboxeswithrowsof desks will do the opposite. Perhaps most important of all,institutions need to start re-examining their futuregrowthplans for buildings on campus. In particular: • will we need additionalclassrooms and additionallecture theatre buildings if students will bespending up to half their time studying online or in flipped classes? • do we have enough learning areas where large numbers of students can work in small groups and can then quickly reconvene? • do we have the technical facilities that will allow students seamlessly to work and study both face-to-face and online, and to share and capture the work when working physically together on campus? • would we be better investing in the re-design of existing space rather than building new learning spaces? What is clear is that institutions now needto do some hard thinking about online learning, its likely impactoncampusteaching,andaboveallwhatkindofcampusexperience wewantstudentstohave whentheycandomuchoftheirstudyingonline.Itisthisthinkingthatshouldshapeourinvestmentin buildings, desks and chairs. 10.5.4Re-thinking the role of the campus Ifweaccepttheprincipleofequalsubstitutionformanyacademicpurposes,thenthisbringsusbackto thestudentonthebusquestion.Ifstudentscanlearnmostthingsequallywell(andmoreconveniently) online,whatcanweofferthemoncampusthatwillmakethebusjourneyworthwhile?Thisisthereal challenge that online learning presents. It is not just a question of what teaching activities need to be done in a face-to-face class or lab, butthewholeculturalandsocialpurposeof a school, college oruniversity.

Image: © www.protectpeel.ca, CC BY-NC Over a number of years, research facultyin the Departmentsof Land Management and Forestryat the University of Western Canada had developed a range of digital graphics, computer models and simulations about watershed management, partly as a consequence of research conducted by faculty, and partly to generate support and funding for further research. At a faculty meeting severalyears ago, after a somewhat heated discussion, faculty members voted, byafairlysmall majority, to maketheseeducational resourcesopenly available for re-use for educational purposes under a Creative Commons license that requires attribution and prevents commercial use without specific written permission from the copyright holders, the faculty responsible for developing the artefacts. What swayed the vote is that the majority of the faculty actively involved in the research wanted to make these resources more widely available. The agencies responsible for funding the work that resulted in the development of the learning artefacts (mainly national research councils) welcomed the move to makes these artefacts more widely available as open educational resources. 561 Initially,theresearchersjustputthegraphicsandsimulationsupontheresearchgroup’s website.Itwaslefttoindividualfacultymemberstodecidewhethertousetheseresources in their teaching. Over time, faculty started to introduce these resources into a range of on-campus undergraduate and graduate courses. After a while, though, word seemed to get out about these OER. Research members began to receive e-mails and phone calls from other researchers around the world. It became clear that there was a network or community of researchers in this field who were creating digital materials as a result of their research, and it made sense to share and re-use materials from other sites. This eventually led to an international web ‘portal’ of learning artefacts on watershed management. The researchers also started to get calls from a range of different agencies, from government ministries or departments of environment, local environmental groups, First Nations/aboriginal bands, and, occasionally, major mining or resource extraction companies, leading to some major consultancy work for the faculty in the departments. At the same time, thefacultywere able to attract further research funding from non.governmental agencies such as the Nature Conservancy and some ecological groups, as well as from their traditional funding source, the national research councils, to develop more OER. By this time, the departmentshad access to a fairly large amount of OER. There were already two fourth and fifth level fully online courses built around the OER that were being offered successfully to undergraduate and graduate students.A proposal was therefore put forward to create initially a fully online post-graduate certificate program on watershed management, built around existing OER, in partnership with a university in the USA and another one in Sierra Leone. This certificate program was to be self-funding from tuition fees, with the tuition fees for the 25 Sierra Leone students to be initially coveredby an international aid agency. The Dean, after a period of hard negotiation, persuaded the university administration that the departments’proportion of the tuition fees from the certificate program should go directly to the departments, who would hire additional tenured faculty from the revenues to teach or backfill for the certificate, and the departmentswould pay 25 per cent of the tuition revenues to the university as overheads.This decision was made somewhat easier by a fairly substantial grant from Foreign Affairs Canada to make the certificate programavailable in English and French to Canadian mining and resource extraction companies with contracts and partners in African countries. Although the certificate program was very successful in attracting students from North America, Europe and New Zealand, itwas not taken up very well in Africa beyond the partnership with the university in Sierra Leone, although there was a lot of interest in the OER and the issues raised in the certificate courses. After two years of running the certificate, then, the departmentsmade two major decisions: • anotherthreecoursesandaresearchprojectwouldbeadded tothecertificate courses, and this would be offered as a fully cost recoverable online master in watershed resource management. This would attract greater participation from managers and professionals in African countries in particular, and provide a recognised qualification that many of the certificate students were requesting; • drawing on the very large network of external experts now involved one way or another with the researchers,the universitywould offer a series of MOOCs on watershed management issues, with volunteer experts from outside the university being invited to participate and provide leadership in the MOOCs. The MOOCs would be able to draw on the existing OER. Five years later, the following outcomes were recorded by the Dean at an international conference on sustainability: • theonline master’s programhaddoubledthetotalnumberofgraduatestudentsin her Faculty; • the master’s program was fully cost-recoverable from tuition fees; • there were 120 graduates a year from the master’s program; • the degree completion rate was 64 per cent; • six new tenured faculty had been hired, plus another six post-doctoral research staff; • several thousand students had registered and paid for at least one course in the certificate or master’s program, of which 45 per cent were from outside Canada; • over 100,000 students had taken the MOOCs, almost half from developing countries; • there were now over 1,000 hours of OER on watershed management available and downloaded many times across the world; • theuniversitywasnowinternationallyrecognised asaworldleaderinwatershed management. Althoughthisscenarioispurelyafigmentofmyimagination,itisinfluencedbyrealandexcitingwork being done by the following at the University of British Columbia: • Dr. Hans Schreier,Watershed Management Courses, Institute of Resources, Environment and Sustainability, UBC • Virtual Soil ScienceLearning Resources(developed by a consortium of British Columbian universities) • Graduate Certificate in Technology-Based Learning, Division of Continuing Studies/Faculty of Education, UBC • International Master in Educational Technology, Faculty of Education, UBC 11.1Open learning Figure 11.1.1 ‘I’m just a committed and even stubborn person who wants to see every child getting quality education…’ Malala Yousafzai’s Nobel Prize speech, 2014. Click on image to see the speech. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in open learning, mainly related to open educational resources and MOOCs.

These are offered by national open universities or more recently by theOERu; • open access to courses or programs that arenot for formal credit, although it may be possible to acquire badges or certificates for successful completion.MOOCs are a goodexample; • open educational resources that instructors or learners can use for free.MIT’s OpenCourseware,which provides free online downloads of MIT’s video recorded lectures and support material, is one example; • open textbooks, online textbooks that are free for students to use (such as this one); • open research, whereby research papers are made available online for free downloading (see for instanceOpen Research Central); • open data, that is, dataopen toanyone to use, reuse, and redistribute,subject only, at most, to the requirement to attributeand share;see for example the World Bank’sOpen Data Bank; • open pedagogy, a method of teaching and learning that builds on principles of open-ness and learner participation Eachofthesedevelopmentsisdiscussedinmoredetailinthischapter,exceptforMOOCs,whichare discussed extensively inChapter 5. 11.1.2 Education for all – except higher education Openeducationis primarilyagoal,oraneducationalpolicy. Anessentialcharacteristic ofopen educationis the removal of barriers to learning. It can mean no prior qualifications to study, no discrimination by gender, race, age or religion, affordability for everyone, and for students with disabilities, through a determined effort to provide education in a suitable form that overcomes the disability(forexample,audiorecordingsforstudentswhoarevisuallyimpaired).Ideally,no-oneshould be denied access to an openeducationalprogram. Thus open learning must be scalable as well as flexible. 11.1.2.1State-funded schools State-funded public education for the education of children from around the age of five through to sixteenorinsomecountrieseighteenisthemostextensiveandwidespreadformofopeneducation.For example,theBritishgovernmentpassedthe1870EducationActthatsettheframeworkforschoolingof allchildrenbetweentheagesof5and13inEnglandandWales.Althoughthereweresomefeestobe paidbyparents,theActestablishedtheprinciplethateducationwouldbepaidformainlythroughtaxes andnochildwouldbeexcludedforfinancialreasons.Schoolswouldbeadministeredbyelectedlocal school boards (Living Heritage,undated). Overtime,accesstopubliclyfundededucationinmosteconomicallydevelopedcountrieshasbeen widenedtoincludeallchildrenuptotheageof18.UNESCO’sEducationforAll(EFA)movementis aglobalcommitmenttoprovidequalitybasiceducationforallchildren,youthandadults,supported,at leastinprinciple,by164nationalgovernments.Neverthelesstodaythereareover250millionof‘out.of-school’ children, adolescents and youth worldwide (UNESCO,2018), or roughly one in five. 11.1.2.2 Post-secondary education Accesstopost-secondary orhighereducationhasbeen morelimitedthanaccesstoschools,partly on financialgrounds,butalsointermsof‘merit’.Universitieshaverequiredthoseapplyingforuniversity tomeetacademicstandardsdeterminedbyprior successinschoolexaminations orinstitutionalentry exams. This has enabled elite universities in particular to be highly selective. However, after the Second World War, the demand for an educated population, both for social andeconomicreasons,in mosteconomicallyadvancedcountriesresultedinthegradualexpansionof universitiesandpost-secondaryeducationingeneral.InmostOECDcountries,roughly35-60percent ofanagecohortwillgoontosomeformofpost-secondaryeducation.Especiallyinadigitalage,thereis anincreasingdemandforhighlyqualifiedworkers,andpost-secondaryeducationisanecessarygateway to most of the best jobs. Therefore there is increasing pressure forfull and free open access topost.secondary, higher or tertiary education. 11.1.2.3The cost of widening access However, as we saw in Chapter 1, the cost of widening access to ever increasing numbers results inincreased financial pressureon governments and taxpayers.

Ifyouranswerisnotothefirstpartofthisquestion,whyshouldeducationuptopost-secondaryeducation be open, but not afterwards? Is it simply money, or are there other reasons? 2.Are open universities still relevant in a digital age? 11.2 Open educational resources (OER) Figure 11.2.1 © Giulia Forsyth, 2012 Open educational resourcesare somewhat different from open learning, in that they areprimarily content,whileopenlearningincludesbothcontentandeducationalservices,suchasspeciallydesigned online materials, in-built learner support and assessment. Openeducationalresourcescoverawiderangeofonlineformats,includingonlinetextbooks,video recorded lectures, YouTube clips, web-based textual materials designed for independent study, animationsandsimulations,digitaldiagramsandgraphics,someMOOCs,orevenassessmentmaterials suchastestswithautomated answers.OERcan alsoincludePowerpointslides orpdffilesoflecture 571 notes. In order to be open educational resources, though, they must be freely available for at least educational use. 11.2.1Principles of OER David Wiley isone ofthe pioneers of OER. He and colleagueshave suggested (Hilton et al., 2010) thatthere are five core principles (the 5Rs) of open publishing: • re-use: The most basic level of openness. People are allowed to use all or part of the work for their own purposes (for example, download an educational video to watch at a later time); • re-distribute: People can share the work with others (for example, senda digital article by-email to a colleague); • revise: People can adapt, modify, translate, or change the work (for example, take a book written in English and turn it into a Spanish audio book); • re-mix: People can take two or more existing resources and combine them to create a new resource (for example, take audio lectures from one course and combine them with slides from another course to create a new derivative work); • retain: No digital rights management restrictions (DRM); the content is yours to keep, whether you’re the author, an instructor using the material, or a student. Thisopentextbookyou are reading meetsallfivecriteria(it has a CCBY-NC license – see Section 11.2.2below).UsersofOERthoughneedtocheckwiththeactuallicenseforre-use,becausesometimes therearelimitations,aswiththisbook,whichcannotbereproducedforcommercialpurposeswithout permission.For example, the origin of the work must be accurately attributed to the original author (BY),andit cannotbeconvertedby acommercialpublisherinto aprintedbook tobesold ataprofit (NC), at least without written permission from the author. To protect your rights as an author of OERusually means publishing under a Creative Commons or other open license. 11.2.2 Creative Commons licenses Thisseeminglysimpleidea,ofan‘author’creatingalicenseenablingpeopletofreelyaccessandadapt copyright material, without charge or special permission, is one of the great ideas of the 21stcentury. This does not take away the author’s copyright, but the license gives permissionautomatically for different kinds of use of the material without charge or any paperwork or written permissions. Figure 11.2.2 The spectrum of Creative Commons licenses © The Creative Commons, 2013 There are severalpossible Creative Commons licenses: • CC BY Attribution:lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered. Recommended for maximum dissemination and use of licensed materials; • CC BY-SA:lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. This is particularly important if your work also includes other people’s materials licensed through the Creative Commons; • CC BY-ND:allows for redistribution, commercial and non-commercial, as long as it is passed along unchanged and in whole, with credit to you; • CC BY-NC:lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge you and be non-commercial, they don’t have to license their derivative works on the same terms; • CC BY-NC-SA:lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms; • CC BY-NC-ND:the most restrictive of thesix main licenses, only allowing others to download your works and share them with others as long as they credit you, but they can’t change them in any way or use them commercially. Ifyouwishtoofferyourownmaterialsasopeneducationalresources,itisarelativelysimpleprocess tochoosealicenceandapplyittoanypieceofwork(seeCreativeCommonsChooseaLicense).Ifin doubt, check with a librarian. 11.2.3Sources of OER There are many ‘repositories’ of open educational resources (see for instance, for post-secondary education, MERLOT,OERCommons,andfork-12,Edutopia).TheOpen ProfessionalsEducation Network has anexcellent guide to finding and using OER. However,whensearchingforpossibleopeneducationalresourcesontheweb,checktoseewhether ornottheresourcehasaCreativeCommonslicenseorastatementgivingpermissionforre-use.Itmay becommonpracticetousefree(nocost)resourceswithoutworryingundulyaboutcopyright,butthere areriskswithoutaclearlicenseorpermissionforre-use.Forinstance,manysites,suchasOpenLearn, allowonlyindividual,personalusefornon-commercialpurposes,whichmeansprovidingalinktothe siteforstudentsratherthanintegratingthematerialsdirectlyintoyour ownteaching.Ifinanydoubt about the right to re-use, check with your library or intellectual property department. 11.2.4Limitations of OER Thetake-upofOER,otherthanopentextbooks(seenextsection),byinstructorsisstillminimal,other than by those who created the original version. For instance, in Canada in 2017, less than half the institutions reported use of OER(Donovan et al.,2018). 11.2.4.1Quality issues ThemaincriticismisofthepoorqualityofmanyoftheOERavailableatthemoment–reamsoftext withnointeraction,oftenavailableinPDFsthatcannoteasilybechangedoradapted,crudesimulation, poorlyproducedgraphics,anddesignsthatfailtomakeclearwhatacademicconceptstheyaremeantto illustrate. Falconer(2013),in asurveyofpotential users’attitudes toOERinEurope, cametothefollowing conclusion: The ability of the masses to participate in production of OER – and a cultural mistrust of getting something for nothing – give rise to user concerns about quality. Commercial providers/publishers who generate trust through advertising, market coverage and glossy production, may exploit this mistrust of the free. Belief in quality is a significant driver for OER initiatives, but the issue of scale-able ways of assuring quality in a context where all (in principle) can contribute has not been resolved, and the question of whether quality transfers unambiguously from one context to another is seldom [addressed]. A seal of approval system is not infinitely scale-able, while the robustness of user reviews, or other contextualised measures, has not yet been sufficiently explored. IfOERaretobetakenupbyothersthanthecreatorsoftheOER,theywillneedtobewelldesigned. It is perhaps not surprising then that the most used OER on iTunes University were the Open University’s,untiltheOUsetupitsownOERportal,OpenLearn,whichoffersasOERmainlytextual materialsfromitscoursesdesignedspecificallyforonline,independentstudy.Onceagain,designisa critical factor in ensuring the quality of an OER. 11.2.4.2Instructors’ professional self-image Hampson (2013)has suggested another reason for the slow adoption of OER,mainly to do with the professional self-image of many faculty. Hampson argues that facultydon’t see themselves as ‘just’ teachers,butcreatorsanddisseminatorsofnewororiginalknowledge.Thereforetheirteachingneedsto havetheirownstamponit,whichmakesthemreluctanttoopenlyincorporateor‘copy’otherpeople’s work. OER can easily be associated with ‘packaged’, reproductive knowledge, and not original work, changingfacultyfrom‘artists’to‘artisans’.Itcanbearguedthatthisreasonisabsurd–weallstandon theshouldersofgiants–butitistheself-perceptionthat’simportant,andforresearchprofessors,there isagrainoftruthintheargument.Itmakessenseforthemtofocustheirteachingontheirownresearch. But then how manyRichard Feynmansare there out there? 11.2.4.3 Free or open? Thereisalsoconsiderableconfusionbetween‘free’(nofinancialcost)and‘open’,whichiscompounded bylackofclearlicensinginformationonmanyOER.Forinstance,someCourseraMOOCsarefree,but not‘open’:itisabreachofcopyrighttore-usethematerialinmostCourseraMOOCswithinyourown teachingwithoutpermission.TheedXMOOCplatformisopensource,whichmeansotherinstitutions canadoptoradapttheportalsoftware,butinstitutionsevenonedXtendtoretaincopyright.However, there are exceptions on both platforms: a fewMOOCs do have an open licence. 11.2.4.4Situating OER Thereisalsotheissueofthecontext-freenatureofOER.Researchintolearningshowsthatcontentis bestlearnedwithincontext(situatedlearning),whenthelearnerisactive,andthataboveall,whenthe learnercanactivelyconstructknowledgebydevelopingmeaningand‘layered’understanding.Content is not static, nor a commodity like coal. In other words, content is not effectively learned if it is thought of as shovelling coal into a truck. Learning is a dynamic process that requires questioning, adjustment of prior learning to incorporate new ideas, testing of understanding, and feedback. These ‘transactional’ processes require a combination of personal reflection, feedback from an expert (the teacherorinstructor)andevenmoreimportantly,feedbackfromandinteractionwithfriends,familyand fellow learners. Theweaknesswithopencontentisthatbyitsnature,atitspurestitisstrippedofthesedevelopmental, contextualand‘environmental’componentsthatareessentialforeffectivelearning.Inotherwords,OER arejustlikecoal,sittingtherewaitingtobeloaded.Coalofcourseisstillaveryvaluableproduct.Butit has to be mined, stored, shipped and processed. MoreattentionneedstobepaidtothosecontextualelementsthatturnOERfromraw‘content’intoa usefullearningexperience.Thismeansinstructorsneedtobuildlearningexperiencesorenvironments into which the OER will fit.

AnotherimportantresearchprojectisROER4D,whichaimstoprovideevidence-basedresearchonOER adoption acrossa number of countries in South America, Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. 11.2.5How to use OER Despitetheselimitations,teachersandinstructorsareincreasinglycreatingopeneducationalresources, or making resources freely available for others to use under a Creative Commons license. There are increasingnumbersofrepositoriesorportalswherefacultycanaccessopeneducationalresources.As thequantityofOERexpands,itismorelikelythatteachersandinstructorswillincreasinglybeableto find the resources that best suit theirparticular teaching context. There are therefore several choices: • take OER selectively from elsewhere, and incorporate or adapt them into your owncourses; • create your own digital resources for your own teaching, and make them available to others (see for instanceCreating OER and Combining Licensesfrom Florida State University); • build a course around OER, where students have to find content to solve problems, write reports or do research on a topic (seeScenario Hat the beginningof this chapter, andChapter 11, Section 4.2); • take a whole course fromOERu, then build student activities and assessment and provide learner support for the course. LearnerscanuseOERtosupportanytypeoflearning.Forinstance,MIT’sOpenCourseWare (OCW) couldbeusedjustforinterest,orstudentswhostrugglewiththetopicsinaclassroomlectureforacredit course may well go to OCW to get an alternative approach to the same topic. 11.2.6Still worth the effort DespitesomeofthecurrentlimitationsorweaknessesofOER,theiruseislikelytogrow,simplybecause itmakes nosensetocreate everythingfromscratchwhengoodqualitymaterials arefreelyandeasily available.

Some textbooks cost $200 or more, and in the USA a university undergraduate spends on average between $530 – $640 a year on textbooks (Hill, 2015), although the cost ofrecommended textbooks isbetween $968 and $1221 (Caulfield,2015). Anopentextbookontheotherhandisanopenly-licensed,onlinepublicationfreefordownloadingfor educationalornon-commercialuse.Youarecurrentlyreadinganopentextbook.Thereisanincreasing numberof sourcesforopentextbooks,such asOpenStaxCollegefromRiceUniversity, andtheOpen Academics Textbook Catalogat the University of Minnesota. In British Columbia, the provincial government funded the B.C. open textbook project, which operatesincollaborationinitiallywiththeprovincesofAlbertaandSaskatchewan, butnowalsowith otherprovinces throughthe Canada OER Group. The B.C. open textbook project focuses onmaking available openly-licensed textbooks in the highest-enrolled academic subject areas and also in trades andskillstraining.IntheB.C.project,asinmanyoftheothersources,allthebooksareselected,peer reviewedandinsomecasesdevelopedbylocalfaculty.Oftenthesetextbooksarenot‘original’work,in thesenseofnewknowledge,butcarefullywrittenandwellillustratedsummariesofcurrentthinkingin the different subject areas. 11.3.1.1 Advantages of open textbooks Students and governments, through grants and financial aid, pay billions of dollars each year on textbooks. Open textbooks can make a significant impact on reducing the cost of education. The governmentofBritishColumbiaestimatesthattheBCOpenTextbookprojecthassavedtheroughly 300,000post-secondarystudentsintheprovincemorethat$4millionintextbookcostsbetween2012to 2017 (Bernard,2017). CableGreen,theInterimCEOoftheCreativeCommons,hasa‘vision’foropentextbooks:100per centofstudentshave100percentfree,digitalaccesstoallcoursematerialsbydayone.Thatisfarfrom the case today. DeNoyelles and Raible at the University of Central Florida found (2017)that due to high costs: • 30 percent of [student] respondents said they have opted not to purchase a textbook at least once, • 41 percent have delayed purchasing a textbook, and • 15 percent have taken fewer courses or decided not take a particular class. DeNoyelles and Raible concluded that: • the cost of textbooks is negatively impacting student access to required materials (66.6% did not purchase the required textbook) and learning (37.6% earn a poor grade; 19.8% fail a course). A survey of all public post-secondary students in Florida conducted by the Florida Virtual Campus (2016) found that due to the high costs of textbooks: • time to graduation and/or access to courses is impacted by cost. Students reported that they occasionally or frequently take . fewer courses (47.6%); . do not register for a course (45.5%); . drop a course (26.1%), or . withdraw from courses (20.7%). Therearealsootherconsiderations.Itisacommonsighttoseelengthyline-upsatcollegebookstoresall throughthefirstweekofthefirstsemester(whicheatsintovaluablestudytime).Becausestudentsmay besearchingforsecond-handversionsofthebooksfromotherstudents,itmaywellbeintothesecond or third week of the semester before students actually get their copy. So why shouldn’t government pay the creators of textbooks directly, cut out the middleman (commercial publishers), save over 80per centon the cost, and distribute the books to students (or anyone else) for free over the Internet, under a Creative Commons license? 11.3.1.2 Limitations of open textbooks Facultyresistanceisstillaproblemforopentextbooks.Opentextbookshadbeenadoptedinbetween halfandtwothirdsofallpost-secondaryinstitutionsinCanadain2017,andafurther20percentwere exploring their use.However, thisvaried considerably byprovince.In BritishColumbia, 90per cent ofallpost-secondaryinstitutionshadadoptedopentextbooksfor somecourses;inSaskatchewanand Quebec,lessthanathirdofinstitutionswereusingopentextbooks(Donovanetal.,2018).Thisindicates clearlytheimpactofgovernmentsupportforopentextbooks.Adoptionwashighestinuniversitiesand largeinstitutions.Donovan etal.alsofoundthatthere wasalackofknowledgeand evenmoresoof training for instructors in the use of open textbooks and OER. Murphy(2013)hasquestionedthewholeideaoftextbooks,whetheropenornot.Sheseestextbooks as a relic of 19th century industrialism, a form of mass broadcasting. In the 21st century, students should be finding, accessing and collecting digital materials over the Internet. Textbooks are merely packagedlearning,withtheauthorsdoingtheworkforstudents.Nevertheless,ithastoberecognized thattextbooksarestillthebasiccurrencyformostformsofeducation,andwhilethisremainsthecase, open textbooks are a much better alternative for students than expensive printed textbooks. Quality also remains a concern. There is an in-built prejudice that ‘free’ must mean poor quality.ThusthesameargumentsaboutqualityofOERalsoapplytoopentextbooks.Inparticular,the expensivecommerciallypublishedtextbooksusuallyincludein-builtactivities,supplementarymaterials suchasextrareadings,andevenassessmentquestions.Nevertheless,JhangianiandJhangiani(2017),in asurveyof320undergraduatestudentsinBritishColumbiawhohadactuallyusedanopentextbookfor oneormoreoftheircourses,foundthat 96%ofrespondentsperceivedthequalityoftheiropentextbook to be equal or superior to a commercial textbook. Others(includingmyself)questionthelikelyimpactof‘open’publishingoncreatingoriginalworks thatarenotlikelytogetsubsidizedbygovernmentbecausetheyareeithertoospecialized,orarenotyet partofastandardcurriculumforthesubject;inotherwordswillopenpublishingimpactnegativelyon thediversityofpublishing?Whatistheincentiveforsomeonenowtopublishauniquework,ifthereis nofinancialrewardfortheeffort?Writinganoriginal,singleauthoredbookremainshardwork,however it is published. Although there is now a range of ‘open’ publishing services, there are still costs for an author to create original work.

In Canada, the Minister of State for Science and Technology announced (February 27, 2015) that: The harmonized Tri-Agency Open Access Policy on Publications requires all peer-reviewed journal publications funded by one of the three federal granting agencies to be freely available online within 12 months. AlsoinCanada,SupremeCourtdecisionsandnewlegislationin2014meansthatitismucheasier toaccessandusefreeofchargeonlinematerialsforeducationalpurposes,althoughtherearestillsome restrictions. Commercialpublishers,whohavedominatedthemarketforacademicjournals, areunderstandably fighting back. Where an academicjournal has a high reputation and hence carries substantial weight intheassessmentofresearchpublications,publishersarechargingresearchersformakingtheresearch openlyavailable.Thekudosofpublishinginanestablishedjournalactsasadisincentiveforresearchers to publish in less prestigious open journals without having to pay to get published. However, it can only be a question of time before academics fight back against this system, by establishingtheirownpeerreviewedjournalsthatwillbeperceivedtobeofthehigheststandardbythe qualityofthepapersandthestatusoftheresearcherspublishinginsuchjournals.Onceagain,though, openresearchpublishingwillflourishonlybymeetingthehigheststandardsofpeerreviewandquality research,byfindingasustainablebusinessmodel,andbyresearchersthemselvestakingcontroloverthe publishing process. Over time, therefore, we can expect nearly all academic research in journals to become openly available. 11.3.3Open data Thetwomainsourcesofopendataarefromscienceandgovernment.Followinganintensediscussion withdata-producinginstitutionsinmemberstates,theOECDpublishedin2007theOECD Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding.

It’s a form of experiential learning in which students demonstrate understanding through the act of creation. The products of open pedagogy are student created and openly licensed so that they may live outside of the classroom in a way that has an impact on the greater community. Open projects frequently result in the creation of open educational resources (OER). OER are free teaching and learning materials that are licensed to allow for revision and reuse. They can be fully self-contained textbooks, videos, quizzes, learning modules, and more. Iliketheabovedefinitionbecauseitfocusesonstudentbehaviour,whereopeneducationalmaterials are a by-product of their learning, rather than the starting point, although open pedagogy can also embrace OER as a starting point. Hegarty (2015) describes eight attributes of open pedagogy: • participatory technologies: socially constructed media such as blogs, wikis and other ‘sharing’ social media; • people, openness and trust: students’ willingness to learn is fragile, with participation and interactions unlikely to flourish unless an element of trust can be built (Mak et.,2010); • innovation and creativity: finding new models of teaching and learning that better exploit OER and more emphasis on choosing digital technologies and methods that encourage the sharing of knowledge and resources; • sharing ideas and resources: an open pedagogy needs peers to share willingly within a connected and trusting and professional community; • connected community: a technologically linked community with common interests; • learner-generated: this requires ‘opening up’ the process to empower students to take the lead, solve problems, and work collectively to produce artifacts that they share, discuss, reconfigure, and redeploy • reflective practice: whenstudents and teachers collaborate in partnerships, it facilitates deeper pedagogical reflection • peer review: Conole (2014) sees learners as publishers and users of a range of open tools, with peer interactions and critique embedded in the learning experience. Hegarty also makes the point that it is almost impossible to separate the components of an open pedagogy into neat, segregated dimensions. Components in each of the eight dimensions overlap in many ways. DeRosa and Robison (2017) set out the key idea of open pedagogy in the following: By replacing a static textbook — or other stable learning material — with one that is openly licensed, faculty have the opportunity to create a new relationship between learners and the information they access in the course. Instead of thinking of knowledge as something students need to download into their brains, we start thinking of knowledge as something continuously created and revised. Whether students participate in the development and revision of OER or not, this redefined relationship between students and their course ‘texts’ is central to the philosophy of learning that the course espouses. If faculty involve their students in interacting with OER, this relationship becomes even more explicit, as students are expected to critique and contribute to the body of knowledge from which they are learning. In this sense, knowledge is less a product that has distinct beginning and end points and is instead a process in which students can engage, ideally beyond the bounds of the course. 11.4.2Examples of open pedagogy Thereis acloseconnectionbetweennetworking,socialmediasuch asblogsandwikis,whichenable students to create open educational resources, and open pedagogy. JonBeasley-Murray’scoursewherestudentscreatedaWikipediaentryonLatinAmericanliterature isagoodexample,asistheMathExamResourcescreatedbygraduatestudentsatUBC(seeChapter 9,Section8.8.3).Thisapproachisparticularlyvaluableforpartlyredressingculturalandhistoricalbias, throughtheorganizationofWikipediaedit-a-thons.Fortwoexamples,seeWomeninRed/Indigenous Women.andIndigenous Literature Edit-a-Thon. The Universidad de Guadalajara (Mexico) has an interesting web site (in English) that provides a number of examples of open pedagogy from around the world, related to itsAgoraproject. Anotherpracticeofopenpedagogyaretextbook-freedegrees,calledZedCredsorZ-degreesbutalso ZTC(zerotextbookcost).RoyalRoadsUniversity’sMastersofArtsinLearningandTechnologyisthe firstmasterofartsdegreeinCanadatogotextbook-free.Studentscanaccessallofthecoursematerials through open educational resources, e-books, journal articles and other free digital resources. These types of coursesaim to improve access to education and enhance student outcomes. Many more examples of open pedagogy in practice can be found in Jhangiani and Biswas-Diener (2017) and in theOpen Pedagogy Notebook. Lastly, there is a related movement around open educational infrastructure and technology that challengeseducationalinstitutionsandstudentstothinkaboutwhoownsthetechnologyanddatabeing usedforteachingandlearningandhowopeneducationpractices canbeenabledbyopeneducational technologies (see, for exampleOpenETC.) 11.4.3 The need to provide a framework to support open educational resources The search for a pedagogical and organizational framework to support the use of open educational resourceshasbeendrivenpartlybytherelativeslownessofadoptionofOER.Togiveasimpleexample, instructorsarereluctanttomoveawayfromexpensivecommercialfirstyeartextbooks,becausethese booksoftencomewithawiderangeofsupportmaterials,suchasinteractivewebsiteswithsampleexam questionsandanswers,multiple-choicequestions,andalternativereading.Opentextbooksneedtocome withsimilarsupportingmaterials,studentactivitiesandawider‘network’ofsupporttocompetewith commercial textbooks. PaulStacey,theDirectoroftheOpenEducationConsortium,hasmused(2018)thattoomuchfocus isgiventolicensingandcontentdevelopment,andnotenoughtocollectivelymanagingopenresources sothattheyaresustainableanddynamic.HearguesthatOER,tobeeffective,need‘commoning’,which reflects the management and sustainability of common, shared resources and services. He argues for: • a social system for the long-term stewardship of resources that preserves shared values and community identity; • a self-organized system by which communities manage resources (both depletable and and replenishable) with minimal or no reliance on the Market or State.Simply having a community and pool of resources is not enough.There needs to be a set of protocols, values and norms devised by the community to manage its resources. Openpedagogycouldprovideanimportantpedagogicalpartofsuchaframework,butStaceyseemsto be suggesting that support needs to go beyond pedagogy to a social and management structure. 11.4.4Is open pedagogy a useful construct? SomeofyoumayfeellikeMolière’sBourgeoisGentilhommeafteralessonfromhistutor:‘Ihavebeen speakingprosefor40yearsandneverrealisedit.’Theconceptof‘openpedagogy’hasbeenaroundfor a long time, even if it has seen a revival resulting from the development of OER. LordCrowther,inaspeechpresentingthecharteroftheBritishOpenUniversityin1969,definedthe Open University as: • open to people: “We took it as axiomatic” said the Planning Committee “that no formal academic qualifications would be required for registration as a student…Anyone could try his or her hand, and only failure to progress adequately would be a bar to continuation of studies.” • open to places: “This University has no cloisters – a word meaning closed. We have no courts – or spaces enclosed by buildings….Wherever the English language is spoken or understood, or used as a medium of study, and wherever there are men and women seeking to develop their individual potentialities beyond the limits of the local provision – and I have defined a large part of the world – there we can offer our help.” • open to methods: ‘Every new form of human communication will be examined to see how it can be used to raise and broaden the level of human understanding.” • open to ideas: “It has been said that there are two aspects of education, both necessary. One regards the individual human mind as a vessel, of varying capacity, into which is to be poured as much as it will hold of the knowledge and experience by which human Society lives and moves. This is the Martha of education – and we shall have plenty of these tasks to perform. But the Mary regards the human mind rather as a fire that has to be set alight and blown with the divine efflatus’. Iamnotsurethatopenpedagogyisthedivineefflatus,butCrowther’s understandingofopennessin methods is much wider than modern concepts of open pedagogy. Claude Paquette, following the cultural revolution in Québec, wrote in1979: Une pédagogie ouverte est centrée sur l’interaction qui existe dans une classe entre l’étudiant et l’environnement éducatif qui lui est proposé….Il s’agit d’une façon de penser et d’une façon d’agir. L’éducateur aura donc pour rôle premier de contribuer à l’aménagement de cet environnement éducatif. [Mytranslation:Openpedagogyisfocusedontheinteractionwithinaclassbetweenalearnerand the educational environment that is created for him. It is about a way of thinking and a way of acting.Theprimaryroleoftheteacherthenistocontributetothemanagementofthiseducational environment.’ Notethatthereisnomentionoffreeoropeneducationalresources,andthequotecouldhavecome straight from Rousseau’s ‘Emile’ (1972). It is the basis for the whole ofChapter 6in this book. David Wiley (who was the originator of the term ‘open educational resources’) writes (2017): “Open” …. does not have anything to say about the nature of learning. …you can’t actually build a pedagogy on a foundation of open (well, not one that isn’t incredibly impoverished). Your foundational commitments in terms of pedagogy should be to an understanding of how learning happens. Once we have made fundamental commitments in terms of a theory of learning, then we can add open to our list of facilitating methods in order get better leverage. I wonder if it isn’t nonsensical to talk about “open pedagogy” at all …… Perhaps we should only use open as a modifier for other pedagogies, like “open constructionist pedagogy” or “open connectivist pedagogy” or “open constructivist pedagogy.” It’s clear in each of those cases how open gives you better leverage in terms of supporting learning. Althoughmanyofthepracticesassociatedwithopenpedagogyhavebeenaroundlongbeforeopen educationalresourceswerecreated,OERneverthelessmakesuchpracticesmucheasier toimplement and more powerful. But does this make a new pedagogy? Morgan (2017) raises this issue with respect to the project she worked on for the Universidad de Guadalajara’s Agora project. The Agora design process was focussed on what an open design would actually be ameanstowhich can be summarized as: 1. Open as a means to facilitate a faculty culture of collaboration across the university and across disciplines 2. Open as a means to connect with a broader, global community 3. Open as means to challenge and expand existing understandings of student centre learning 4. Open as means to challenge ways of doing, in this case, the options and possibilities of digital technology and mobile learning 5. Open as a means to make the lives of faculty easier in their pursuit of better teaching and learning 6. Open as a means to create a sustainable approach to faculty development Ultimately we did create content that fits quite nicely with the 5Rs, but the goal of our open pedagogy design process was not to create OERs as a means towards or even as an essential component of open pedagogy. The Agora was alternatively all of the ‘isms – behaviourism, connectivism, constructivism, constructionism – but the ism doesn’t really matter. Importantly, the open pedagogy design was at times technology-enabled and at times it didn’t use technology or the internet at all. OERs didn’t allow us to practice a different pedagogy, rather the open pedagogy of the Agora was a bricolage of activities and practices that at times resulted in OERs and at times didn’t. Pedagogyisprimarilyaboutpractice:whatteachersorlearnersdo.Obviously,practiceisandshould bedrivenbyideasandbeliefs,butitisdifferentfromphilosophy.Learner-centredteachingorlearners creating knowledge (with or without OER) is a pedagogy; ‘open’ is more of an idea and a value. In other words, looking at the quotations above, open is more a philosophy, a way of thinking, that informspractice,ratherthanthepracticeitself.However,thisisasomewhatacademicdistinction.OER isenablingchangesinteachingpractice.However,Ipreferabroadervisionforteachinginadigitalage than one so closely tied to OER. 11.4.5Another vision for pedagogy in a digital age Theincreasingavailabilityofhighqualityopencontentislikelytofacilitatetheshiftfrominformation transmission by the instructor to knowledge management by the learner. Also in a digital age there is a need forgreater focus on skills development embedded within a subject domain than on the memorisation of content. Theuseofopeneducationalresourcescouldenablethesedevelopmentsinanumberofways,suchas: • a learner-centered teaching approach that focuses on students accessing content on the Internet (and in real life) as part of developing knowledge, skills and competencies defined by the instructor, or learners managing their learning for themselves; however, contentwould not be restricted to officially designated open educational resources, but to everything on the Internet, because one of the core skills students will needis how to assess and evaluate different sources of information; • a consortium of teachersor institutions creating common learning materials within a broader program context, that can be shared both within and outside the consortium. However, not only would the content be freely available, but also the underlying instructional principles, learning outcomes, learner assessment strategies, what learner support is needed, learner activities, and program evaluation techniques, so that other instructors or learners can adapt all this to their own context. This approach is already being taken by: . the Carnegie MellonOpen Learning Initiative . to some extent by the UK Open University’sOpenLearnproject . theVirtual University of Small States of the Commonwealth . OER Africa . OERu Overall,suchdevelopmentsarelikelytoleadtoaseverereductioninlecture-basedteachingandamove towardsmoreprojectwork,problem-basedlearningandcollaborativelearning.Itwillalsoresultin a moveawayfromfixedtimeandplacewrittenexaminations,tomorecontinuous,portfolio-basedforms of assessment. Theroleoftheinstructorthenwillshifttoprovidingguidancetolearnersonwhereandhowtofind content,howtoevaluatetherelevanceandreliabilityofcontent,whatcontentareasarecoreandwhat peripheral, and to helping students analyse, apply and present information, within a strong learning designthatfocusesonclearlydefinedlearningoutcomes,particularlywithregardtothedevelopmentof skills.Studentswillworkmainlyonlineandcollaboratively,developingmulti-medialearningartefacts ordemonstrationsoftheirlearning,managingtheironlineportfoliosofwork,andeditingandpresenting selected work for assessment. This is a far broader vision of pedagogy than that built around the use of OER. 11.4.6Conclusion In summary: • increasingly, educational resources are becoming more freely and more openly available for teachers and learners; • OER open up the possibility of greater student participation in the creation as well as the selection of learning materials; • it is essential to embed OER within a robust and appropriate teaching framework or pedagogy that exploits the potential of OER; • OER may lead to a new, open pedagogy, but more likely will lead to the greater adoption and adaptation of existing teaching methods that benefit from the potential of OER; • it is also essential to create organizational environments or management frameworks that encourage and support the development and use of high quality open educational resources; they cannot successfully exist in a vacuum; • what should drive open educational practices and use of OERs should be a broader vision of teaching and learning that focuses on the knowledge and skills students need in a digital age. OER should be embedded in a wider concept of pedagogy than just ‘open’ pedagogy. References Conole, G.

Thelogical next stepwouldbeforstatisticsfacultyacrosstheOntariosystemtogettogetheranddevelopanintegrated setofOERmodulesonstatisticsthatwouldcoversubstantialpartsofthestatisticscurriculum.Working together would have the following benefits: • higher quality by pooling resources (two subject expert heads are better than one, combined with support from instructional designers and web producers); • more OER than one instructor or institution could produce; • subject coherence and lack of duplication; • more likelihood of faculty in one institutionusing materials created in another if they have had input to the selection and design of the OER from other institutions. AstherangeandqualityofOERincreases,instructors(andstudents)willbeabletobuildcurriculum throughasetofOER‘buildingblocks’.Theaimwouldbetoreduceinstructortimeincreatingmaterials andusingtheirtimemoreinsupportingstudentlearningthanindeliveringcontent.Whentheydocreate original material, it can then be shared with other instructors. 11.5.3Disaggregation of services Open education and digitisationenable what has tended to be offered by institutions as a complete bundleofservicestobesplitoutandofferedseparately,dependingonthemarketforeducationandthe unique needs of individual learners.These different services could be as follows: • academic guidance (assessment of learning needs; admission counselling) • choice of educational goals/outcomes/competencies • access to ‘open’ digital content in the form of OER or MOOCs • learner support, including a choice of . topic guidance (build a curriculum) . tutoring on demand (for example, when students are ‘stuck’) . different learning activities (tests, projects, etc.) . feedback on learning activities . assessment preparation • assessment on demand Learnerswillselectandusethosemodulesorservicesthatbestfittheirneeds.Thisislikelytobethe patternforlifelonglearnersinparticular.Someearlyindicationsofthisprocessarealreadyoccurring, although most of the really significant changes are yet to come. Figure 11.5.3 Disaggregation Image: © Aaron ‘tango’ Tan, Flickr, CC Attribution 2.0 11.5.3.1 Admission and program counselling ThisisaservicealreadyofferedbyEmpireStateUniversity,apartoftheStateUniversityofNewYork, throughitspre-enrollmentadvisers.Adultlearnersconsideringareturntostudyoracareerchangecan receivementoringaboutwhat coursesandcombinationsthey cantakefromwithinthecollegethatfit withtheirpreviouslifeandtheirfuturewishes.Inessence,withinboundariespotentialstudentsareable todesigntheirowndegree.Inthefuture,someinstitutionsmightspecialiseinthiskindofserviceata system level. 11.5.3.2Build a curriculum Studentscouldbeadvisedonanappropriatecurriculumthatcanbebuilttofittheirneeds.Forinstance, DalhousieUniversity’sFacultyofComputerScienceshasbuiltatoolcalledDaedaluswhichbasically enables the construction of amap showing the inter-relatedness between specific learning outcomes andcoursecontent,including coursesequencing(seeContactNorth’s PocketsofInnovationformore details). Oncesuchamapofadegreeprogramorotherqualificationorcurriculumhasbeenbuilt,studentscan thennavigatetheirownchoiceofcoursesorroutethroughacurriculum–andperhapsnegotiatewhatis needed for a degree. This could just as easily be based on OER as classroom teaching. 11.5.3.3 Learner support StudentsmayhavealreadydeterminedwhattheywanttostudythroughtheInternet,suchasaMOOC. What they are looking for is help with their studies: how to write assignments, where to look for information,feedbackontheirworkandthinking.Theyarenotnecessarilylookingforacredit,degree orotherqualification, butif they arethey will pay for assessmentseparately. Currently, students pay privatetutorsforthisservice. However, itisfeasiblethatinstitutionscould also providethisservice, provided that a suitable business model can be built. 11.5.3.4Assessment Learnersmayfeelthatthroughpriorstudyandwork,theyareabletotakeachallengeexamforcredit. Alternatively a learner may wish to present a portfolio of work to demonstrate their knowledge and skills. All they require from the institution is a chance to be assessed. Institutions such as Western Governors’ University or the Open Learning division of Thompson Rivers University are already offeringthisservice,andthiswouldbe alogicalnextstepforthemanyotheruniversities orcolleges with some form of prior learning assessment or PLAR. 11.5.3.5‘Assembled’qualifications Learnersmay have acquired a range of credits, badges or certificatesfrom a range of different institutions.Theinstitution assessesthesequalificationsandexperiencesandhelpsthelearner totake anyfurtherstudiesthatarenecessary,thenawardsthequalification.PriorlearningassessmentorPLAR is one step in this direction, but not the only one. 11.5.3.6A discount onfully online courses and programs Forlearnerswho cannotordonotwanttoattendcampus,the coursefeeswouldbelowerforonline courses than for students receiving a full campus experience. 11.5.3.7Open access to content Inthiscase,thelearnerisnotlookingforanyqualification,butwantsaccesstocontent,particularlynew andemergingknowledge.MOOCsareoneexample,butotherexamplesincludeOpenLearnandopen textbooks. 11.5.3.8 The full campus experience Thiswouldbethe‘traditional’integratedpackagethatfull-time,campus-basedstudents nowreceive. Thiswouldthoughbefullycostedandmuchmoreexpensivethananyoftheothersingledisaggregated services. 11.5.3.9 Funding models Note that I have been careful not to link any of these services to a specific funding model. This is deliberate, because it could be: • covered through privatisation, where each service is separately priced and the user pays for that service (but not for others not used); • financed through a voucher system, whereby everyone at the age 18 is entitled to a notional amount of financial support from the state for post-secondary education, and can pay for a range of service from that voucher until their individual fund is exhausted; • all or some services would be available for free as part of a publicly funded open education system • a mix of the above. Whateverthefundingmodel,institutionsdisaggregatingserviceswillneedtobeabletopricedifferent services accurately. 11.5.3.10The argument against disaggregation Therearealsostrongargumentsagainstthedisaggregationofservices.Gallagher(2019)arguesthatthe successfulcollegesanduniversitiesofthefuturewillbeintegrated:coherentlyandcohesivelydesigned to help students achieve a lifelong learning experience that is more than the sum of its parts. However, this is not a question of either/or and should be driven to some extent by the needs of learners at different points in their learning cycle. Most younger students coming from high school probably will need an integrated college experience. However, working adults or students who have graduatedmaynotwant,needorcanaffordthefullpackage.Disaggregationwillprovidetheflexibility needed for lifelong learning. 11.5.3.11 The need for more flexibility in services Inanycase,thereisnowanincreasingdiversityoflearners’needs,fromhighschoolstudentswanting full-timeeducation,graduatestudentswantingtodoresearch,andlifelonglearners,mostofwhomwill havealreadypassedthroughapubliclyfundedhighereducationsystem,wantingtokeeplearningeither forvocationalorpersonalreasons.

Disaggregation of services and new models offunding,combinedwithincreasedaccessibility tofree,opencontent, aresomewaysinwhichthis flexibility can be provided. For alternative views on this issue, see Carey,2015; Large,2015. 11.5.4Conclusions DespiteallthehooplaaroundMOOCs,theyareessentiallyadeadendwithregardtoprovidinglearners whodonothaveadequateaccesstoeducationwithwhattheywant:highqualityqualifications.Themain barriertoeducationisnotlackofcheapcontentbutlackofaccesstoprogramsleadingtocredentials, eitherbecausesuchprogramsaretooexpensive,orbecausetherearenotenoughqualifiedteachers,or both.Makingcontentfreeisnotawasteoftime(ifitisproperlydesignedforsecondaryuse),butitstill needs a lot of time and effort to integrate it properly within a learning framework. Openeducationalresourcesdohaveanimportantroletoplayinonlineeducation,buttheyneedtobe properlydesigned,anddevelopedwithinabroaderlearningcontextthatincludesthecriticalactivities neededtosupportlearning,suchasopportunitiesforstudent-instructorandpeerinteraction,andwithin acultureofsharing,suchasconsortiaofequalpartnersandotherframeworksthatprovideacontextthat encouragesandsupportssharing.Inotherwords,OERneedskillandhardworktomakethemuseful, and selling them as a panacea for education does more harm than good. Althoughopenandflexiblelearninganddistanceeducationandonlinelearningmeandifferentthings, the one thing they all have in common is an attempt to provide alternative means of high quality educationortrainingforthosewhoeithercannottakeconventional,campus-basedprograms,orchoose not to. Lastly, there areno insurmountablelegal or technical barriers now to making educational material free.ThesuccessfuluseofOERdoesthoughrequireaparticularmindsetamongbothcopyrightholders –thecreatorsofmaterials –andusers–teachersandinstructorswhocould usethismaterialintheir teaching. Thus the main challenge is one of cultural change. In the end, a well-funded public higher education system remains the best way to assure access tohighereducation forthe majority ofthepopulation.Having saidthat,thereis enormousscopefor improvements within that system. Open education and its tools offer a most promising way to bring about some much needed improvements. 11.5.5 The future is yours Thisisjustmyinterpretationofhowapproachesto‘open’contentandresourcescouldradicallychange thewayweteachandhowstudentswilllearninthefuture.Atthebeginningofthischapterthereisa scenario I created which suggests how this might play out in one particular program. Moreimportantly,thereisnotjust onefuturescenario,butmany.Thefuturewillbedeterminedby a host of factors, many outside the control of teachers and instructors. But the strongest weapon we haveasteachersisourownimaginationandvision.Opencontentandopenlearningreflectaparticular philosophy of equality and opportunity created through education.

Before I do this, however, it is necessary to clarify what is meant by ‘quality’ in teaching and learning, because I am using ‘quality’ here in a very specific way. 12.1.1Definitions Probablythereis noothertopicineducationwhichgenerates somuchdiscussionandcontroversy as ‘quality’.Manybookshavebeenwrittenonthetopic,butIwillcuttothechaseandgivemydefinition of quality up-front. For the purposes of this book, quality is defined as: teaching methods that successfully help learners develop the knowledge and skills they will require in a digital age. Thisofcourseismyshortanswertothequestionofwhatisquality.Alongeranswermeanslooking, at least briefly, at: • institutional and degree accreditation; • internal (academic) quality assurance processes; • differences in quality assurance between traditional classroom teaching and online and distance education; • the relationship between quality assurance processes and learning outcomes; • ‘quality assurance fit for purpose’: meeting the goals of education in a digital age. Thiswillthenprovidethefoundationsformyrecommendationsforqualityteachingthatwillfollowin this chapter. 12.1.2Institutional and degree accreditation Most governments act to protect consumers in the education market by ensuring that institutions are properly accredited and the qualifications they award are valid and are recognised as of being of ‘quality.’However,themannerinwhichinstitutionsanddegreesareaccreditedvariesagreatdeal.The main difference is between the USA and virtually any other country. TheU.S.DepartmentofEducation’s NetworkforEducationInformationstates initsdescriptionof accreditation and quality assurancein the USA: Accreditation is the process used in U.S. education to ensure that schools, postsecondary institutions, and other education providers meet, and maintain, minimum standards of quality and integrity regarding academics, administration, and related services. It is a voluntary process based on the principle of academic self-governance. Schools, postsecondary institutions and programs (faculties) within institutions participate in accreditation. The entities which conduct accreditation are associations comprised of institutions and academic specialists in specific subjects, who establish and enforce standards of membership and procedures for conducting the accreditation process. Both the federal and state governments recognize accreditation as the mechanism by which institutional and programmatic legitimacy are ensured. In international terms, accreditation by a recognized accrediting authority is accepted as the U.S. equivalent of other countries’ ministerial recognition of institutions belonging to national education systems. In other words, in the USA, accreditation and quality assurance is effectively self-regulated by the educational institutions through their control of accreditation agencies, although the government doeshavesome‘weaponsofenforcement’,mainlythroughthewithdrawalofstudentfinancialaidfor students atany institution that the U.S. Department of Educationdeems to be failing to meet standards. Inmanyothercountries,governmenthastheultimateauthority toaccreditinstitutionsandapprove degrees, although in countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom, this too is often exercised byarm’s lengthagenciesappointedbygovernment,butconsistingmainlyofrepresentativesfromthe various institutions within the system. These bodies have a variety of names, but Degree Quality AssuranceBoardisatypicaltitle.However,inrecentyears,someregulatoryagenciessuchastheUnited Kingdom’s Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Educationhave adopted formal quality assurance processes based on practices that originated in industry. The U.K. QAA’s revisedQuality Code for Higher Educationis set out below: However, althoughhardlycontentious,suchsystem-widecodes aretoogeneralforthespecificsof ensuringqualityinaparticularcourse.Manyinstitutionsasaresultofpressurefromexternalagencies havethereforeputinplaceformalquality assuranceprocessesoverandbeyondthenormalacademic approval processes (see Clarke-Okah and Daniel,2010,for a typical, low-cost example). 12.1.3 Internal quality assurance It can be seen then thatthe internal processes for ensuring quality programs within an institution areparticularly important. Although again the process can vary considerably between institutions, at least in universities the process is fairly standard. 12.1.3.1 Assuring the quality of a program Aproposalforanewdegreewillusuallyoriginate fromagroupoffaculty/instructors withina department.Theproposalwillbediscussedandamendedatdepartmentaland/orFacultymeetings,then onceapprovedwillgototheuniversitysenateforfinalapproval.Theadministrationintheformofthe Provost’sOfficewillusuallybeinvolved,particularlywhereresources,suchasnewappointments,are required. Althoughthisisprobablyanover-generalisation,significantlytheproposalwillcontaininformation about whowill teach the course and their qualifications to teach it, the content tobe covered within theprogram(oftenasalistofcourseswithshortdescriptions),asetofrequiredreadings,andusually something about how students will be assessed. Increasingly, such proposals mayalso include broad learning outcomes for the program. Ifthereisaproposalforcourseswithinaprogramorthewholeprogramtobedeliveredfullyonline, itislikelythattheproposalwillcomeundergreaterinternalscrutiny.Whatisunlikelytobeincludedin aproposalthoughiswhatmethods ofteachingwillbeused.Thisisusuallyconsideredtheresponsibility ofindividualfacultymembersortheindividualteacher(unlessyouareanadjunctorcontractinstructor). It is this aspect of quality – the effectiveness of the teaching method or learning environmentfor developing the knowledge and skills in a digital age – with which this chapter is concerned. 12.1.3.2Assuring the quality of classroom teaching Therearemanyguidelinesforqualitytraditionalclassroomteaching.Perhapsthemostwellknownare thoseofChickeringandGamson(1987),basedonananalysisof50yearsofresearchintobestpractices in teaching. They argue thatgood practice in undergraduate education: 1. Encourages contact between students and faculty. 2. Develops reciprocity and cooperation among students. 3. Encourages active learning. 4. Gives prompt feedback. 5. Emphasizes time on task. 6. Communicates high expectations. 7. Respects diverse talents and ways of learning. However, these standards should apply equally to both face-to-face and online teaching. 12.1.3.3 Quality in online courses and programs Becauseonlinelearningwasnewandhenceopentoconcernaboutitsquality,therehavealsobeenmany guidelines, best practices and quality assurance criteria created and applied to online programming. All these guidelines and procedures have been derived from the experience of previously successful onlineprograms,bestpracticesinteachingandlearning,andresearchandevaluationofonlineteaching andlearning.Acomprehensivelistofonlinequalityassurancestandards,organizationsandresearchon online learning can be found inAppendix 2. JungandLatchem(2012),in areviewofquality assessmentprocessesin alargenumberofonline anddistanceeducationinstitutionsaroundtheworld,makethefollowingimportantpointsaboutquality assurance processes for online and distance education within institutions: • focus on outcomes as the leading measure of quality; • take a systemic approach to quality assurance; • see QA as a process of continuous improvement; • move the institution from external controls to an internal culture of quality; • poor quality has very high costs so investment in quality is worthwhile. Ensuringqualityinonlinelearningisnotrocketscience.Thereisnoneedtobuildabureaucracyaround this,buttheredoesneedtobesomemechanism,somewayofmonitoringinstructorsorinstitutionswhen theyfailtomeetthesestandards.However,weshouldalsodothesameforcampus-basedteaching.As more and more already accredited (and ‘high quality’) campus-based institutions start moving into hybridlearning,theestablishmentofqualityintheonlinelearningelementsofprogramswillbecome even more important. 12.1.4Consistency in applying quality standards There areplenty ofevidence-based guidelinesforensuringquality inteaching,both face-to-face and online. The main challenge then is to ensure that teachers and instructors are aware of these best practicesandthatinstitutionshaveprocessesinplacetoensurethatguidelinesforqualityteachingare implemented and followed. Quality assurance methods are valuable for agencies concerned about rogue private providers, or institutions using onlinelearning to cut corners or reduce costs without maintaining standards (for instance,by hiring untrained adjuncts,and giving them anunacceptably highteacher-studentratio to manage). QA methodscan be useful for providing instructors new to teaching with technology, or strugglingwithitsuse,withmodelsofbestpracticetofollow.Butforanyreputablestateuniversityor college,thesamequalityassurancestandardsshouldapplyequallytoface-to-faceandonlineteaching, even ifslightly adjusted for the difference in delivery method. 12.1.5 Quality assurance, innovation and learning outcomes MostQAprocessesarefront-loaded,inthattheyfocusoninputs–suchastheacademicqualifications offaculty, or theprocesses tobeadopted foreffective teaching, such asclear learningobjectives, or systems-based course design methods, such as ADDIE – rather than outputs, such as what students haveactuallylearned.QAprocessesalsotendtobebackward-looking,thatis,theyfocusonpast best practices. This needs to be considered especially when evaluating new teaching approaches. Butcher and Hoosen (2014) state: The quality assurance of post-traditional higher education is not straightforward, because openness and flexibility are primary characteristics of these new approaches, whereas traditional approaches to quality assurance were designed for teaching and learning within more tightly structured frameworks. However, Butcher and Hoosen (2014) go on to say that: fundamental judgements about quality should not depend on whether education is provided in a traditional or post-traditional manner …the growth of openness is unlikely to demand major changes to quality assurance practices in institutions. The principles of good quality higher education have not changed…. Quality distance education is a sub-set of quality education…Distance education should be subject to the same quality assurance mechanisms as education generally.’ Such arguments though offera particular challenge for teaching in a digital age, where learning outcomes need to include the development of skills such as independent learning, facility in using socialmediaforcommunication,andknowledgemanagement,skillsthathaveoftennotbeenexplicitly identified in the past. Quality assurance processes are not usually tied to specific types of learning outcomes,butaremorecloselylinkedtogeneralperformancemeasuressuchascoursecompletionrates, time to degree completion, orgrades based on past learning goals. Furthermore, we have already seen in Chapters 9, 10 and 11 that new media and new methods of teachingareemergingthathavenotbeenaroundlongenoughtobesubjecttoanalysisofbestpractices. Atoorigidviewofqualityassessmentbasedonpastpracticescouldhaveseriousnegativeimplications for innovation in teaching and formeeting newly emerging learning needs.‘Best practice’ may need occasionally to be challenged, so new approaches can be experimented with and evaluated. 12.1.6Getting to the essence of quality Institutional accreditation, internal procedures for program approval and review, and formal quality assurance processes, while important, particularly forexternal accountability, donot really get tothe heart of what quality is inteaching andlearning. They arerather likethe pompandcircumstance of stateoccasions.Thechangingoftheguardinfrontofthepalaceisceremonial,ratherthanapractical defenceagainstrevolution,invasionoraterroristattackonthePresidentorthemonarchy.Asimportant asceremoniesandrituals aretonationalidentity, astrongstateisboundbydeeperties.Similarly, an effective school, college or university is much more than the administrative processes that regulate teaching and learning. At its worst, quality management can end up with many boxes on a questionnaire being ticked, in that the management processes are all in place, without in fact investigating whether students are reallylearningmoreorbetterasaresultofusingtechnology.Inessence,teachingandlearningarevery human activities, often requiring for success a strong bond between teacher and learner. There is a powerfulaffective or motivational aspect of learning, which a ‘good’ teacher can tap into and steer. Onereasonfortheconcernofmanyteachersandinstructorsaboutusingtechnologyforteachingis thatitwillbedifficultorevenimpossibletodevelopthatemotionalbondthathelpsseealearnerthrough difficultiesorinspiressomeonetogreaterheightsofunderstandingorpassionforthesubject.However, technologyisnowflexibleandpowerfulenough,whenproperlymanaged,toenablesuchbondstobe developed,notonlybetweenteacherandlearner,butalsobetweenlearnersthemselves,eventhoughthey may never meet in person. Thusanydiscussionofqualityineducationneedstorecogniseandaccommodatetheseaffectiveor emotionalaspectsoflearning.Thisis afactorthatis toooftenignoredinbehaviouristapproaches to theuseoftechnologyortoqualityassurance.Consequently,inwhatfollowsinthischapter,aswellas incorporating best practices in technical terms, the more human aspects of teaching and learning are considered, even or especially within technology-based learning environments. 12.1.7 Quality assurance: fit for purpose in a digital age At the end of the day, the best guarantees of quality inteaching and learning fit for a digital age are: • well-qualified subject experts also well trained in both teaching methods and the use of technology for teaching; • highly qualified and professional learning technology support staff; • adequate resources, including appropriate teacher/student ratios; • appropriate methods of working (teamwork, project management); • systematic evaluation leading to continuous improvement. Muchmoreattentionneedstobedirectedatwhatcampus-basedinstitutionsaredoingwhentheymove tohybridoronlinelearning.Aretheyfollowingbestpractices, orevenbetter, developinginnovative, betterteaching methods thatexploitthestrengthsofbothclassroom andonlinelearning?Thedesign ofxMOOCsandthehighdrop-outratesintheUSAofmanytwoyearcollegesnewtoonlinelearning suggest they are not. If the goal or purpose is to develop the knowledge and skills that learners will need in a digital age, then this is the ‘standard’ by which quality should be assessed, while at the same time taking intoaccountwhatwealreadyknowaboutgeneralbestpracticesinteaching.Therecommendationsfor quality teaching in a digital age that follow in this chapter are based on thiskey principleof ‘fit for purpose’. References and further reading Butcher, N. and Hoosen, S.

What wouldyour teaching approach now look like? There is no feedback provided for this activity: it is for your reflection. 12.4 Step two: what kind of course or program? Figure 12.4.1 The continuum of technology-based teaching (from Chapter 10) 12.4.1 Choosing mode of delivery Determiningwhatkindofcourseintermsofthemixofface-to-faceandonlineteachingisthenatural nextstepafterconsideringhowyouwanttoteachacourse.Thistopichasbeendealtwithextensivelyin Chapter10,sotosummarise,therearefourfactorsorvariablestotakeintoaccountwhendecidingwhat ‘mix’ of face-to-face and online learning will be best for your course: • your preferred teaching philosophy – how you like to teach (seeStep 1) • the needs of the students (or potential students) • the demands of the discipline • the resources available to you. Althoughananalysisofallthefactorsisanessentialsetofstepstotakeinmakingthisdecision,inthe enditwillcomedowntoamainlyintuitivedecision,takingintoaccountallthefactors.Thisbecomes particularly important when looking at a program as a whole. 625 12.4.2 Who should make the decision? While individual instructors should be heavily involved in deciding the best mix of online and face.to-face teaching in their specific course, it is worth thinking about this on a program rather than an individualcoursebasis.Forinstance,ifweseethedevelopmentofindependentlearningskillsasakey programoutcome,thenitmightmakesensetostartinthefirstyearwithmainlyface-to-faceclasses,but graduallyoverthelengthoftheprogramintroducestudentstomoreandmoreonlinelearning,sothat the end of a four year degree they are able and willing to take some of their courses fully online. Certainly every program should have a mechanism for deciding not only the content and skills or the curriculum to be covered in a program, but also how the program will be delivered, and hence the balance or mix of online and face-to-face teaching throughout the program. This should become integratedintoanannualacademicplanningprocessthatlooksatbothmethodsofteachingaswellas content to be covered in the program (see Bates and Sangrà,2011). Reference Bates, A. and Sangrà, A. (2011) Managing Technology in Higher Education San Francisco: Jossey–Bass/John Wiley and Co 12.5Step three: work in a team Figure 12.5.1 Work in a team Oneofthestrongestmeansofensuringqualityistoworkasateam.Thisisaddressedatseveralpoints in the book, such asChapter 9, Section 7,Chapter 10, Section 4, andChapter 13,Sections 3and5. 12.5.1 Why work in a team? Formanyteachersandinstructors,classroomteachingisanindividual,largelyprivateactivitybetween the instructor andstudents. Teaching is a very personal affair.However, blended and especially fully 627 onlinelearningaredifferentfromclassroomteaching.Theyrequirearangeofskillsthatmostteachers and instructors, and particularly those new to online teaching, are unlikely to have, at a least in a developed, ready-to-use form. Theway an instructorinteractsonline has tobeorganized differentlyfrominclass, andparticular attentionhastobepaidtoprovidingappropriateonlineactivitiesforstudents,andtostructuringcontent inwaysthatfacilitatelearninginanasynchronousonlineenvironment.Goodcoursedesignisessential toachievequalityin termsofdevelopingtheknowledgeandskillsneededin adigitalage.These are pedagogicalissues,inwhichmostpost-secondaryinstructorshavehadlittletraining.Inaddition,there arealsotechnologyissues.Noviceteachersandinstructorsarelikelytoneedhelpindevelopinggraphics or video materials, for example. Anotherreasontoworkinateamistomanageworkload.Thereisarangeoftechnologicalactivities thatarenotnormallyrequiredofclassroomteachersandinstructors.Justmanagingthetechnologywill beextraworkifinstructorsdoitallthemselves.Also,iftheonlinecomponentofacourseisnotwell designedorintegratedwiththeface-to-facecomponent,ifstudentsarenotclearwhattheyshoulddo, or if the material is presented in ways that are difficult to understand, the teacher or instructor will beoverwhelmedwithstudente-mail. Instructional designers,whowork across differentcourses,and who have training in both course design and technology, can be an invaluable resource for novices teachingonline for the first time. Thirdlyworkingwithcolleaguesinthesamedepartmentwhoaremoreexperiencedinonlinelearning canbeaverygoodmeanstogetquicklytoahighqualityonlinestandard,andagaincansavetime.For instance,inoneuniversityIworkedin,threefacultymembersinthesamedepartmentweredeveloping different courseswithonlinecomponents.However, thesecoursesoftenneededgraphicsofthe same equipmentdiscussedinallthreecourses.Thethreeinstructorsgottogether,andworkedwithagraphic designertocreatehighqualitygraphicsthatweresharedbetweenallthreeinstructors.Thisalsoresulted in discussions about overlap andhow best to make surethere was better integration and consistency between the three courses. They could do this with their online courses more easily than with the classroom courses, because the online course materials can be more easily shared and observed. Lastly,especiallywherelargelectureclassesarebeingre-designed,theremaybeacohortofteaching assistantsthatmayneed tobetrained, organisedandmanaged.Insomeinstitutions,part-timeadjunct faculty will also need to be involved.This means clarifying roles for the senior faculty member, the adjunct or contract faculty, the teaching assistants, and the learning technology support staff. For many teachers and instructors, developing teaching in a team is a big cultural shift. However, the benefits of doing this for online or blended learning are well worth the effort. As teachers and instructorsbecomemoreexperiencedinblendedandonlinelearning,thereislessneedforthehelpof aninstructionaldesigner,butmanyexperiencedinstructorsnowprefertocontinueworkinginateam, because it makes life so much easier for them. 12.5.2Who is in the team? This will depend to some extent on the size of the course. In most cases, for ablended oronline course with one main faculty member or subject expert, and a manageable number of students, the instructorwillnormallyworkwithaninstructionaldesigner,whointurncancallonmorespecialiststaff, such as a web or graphic designer or a media producer, as needed. Ifhoweveritisacoursewithmanystudentsandseveralinstructors,adjunctfacultyand/orteaching assistants,thentheyshouldallworktogether asateam,withtheinstructionaldesigner. Alsoinsome institutions a librarian is an important member of the team, helping identify resources, dealing with copyrightissuesandensuringthatthelibraryisable torespondtolearners’needswhenthe courseis being offered. 12.5.3What about academic freedom? Do I lose it working in a team? No.Theinstructor(s)willalwayshavefinalsay overcontentandhowitis tobetaught.Instructional designersareadvisersbutresponsibilityforthecontentofthecourse,thewayitistaught,andassessment methods always remains with the faculty member. However, instructional andmedia producersshould notbetreated asservants, but as professionals withspecializedskills.Theyshouldberespectedandlistened to.Oftentheinstructionaldesignerwill havemoreexperienceofwhatwillworkandwhatwillnotinblendedoronlinelearning.Surgeonswork withanaesthetistsandnurses,andtrustthemtodotheirjobsproperly.Theworkingrelationshipbetween instructors and instructional designers and media producersshould be similar. 12.5.4Conclusion Working in a team makes life a lot easier for instructors when teaching blended or online courses. Good course design, which is the area of expertise of the instructional designer, not only enables students to learn better but also controls faculty workload. Courses look better with good graphic and web design and professional video production. Specialist technical help frees up instructors to concentrate on teaching and learning. What’s not to like? This of course will depend heavily on the institution providing such support through a centre of teaching and learning. Nevertheless this is an important decision that needs to be implemented before course design begins. 12.6 Step four: build on existing resources Figure 12.6.1 Radiating charge simulation, phET: click on image to run simulation Image: © University of Colorado-Boulder Theimportanceofusingexistingresourceshasbeenstressedinseveralpartsofthebook,particularly Chapters8and11. 12.6.1 Moving content online Timemanagementforteachersandinstructorsiscritical.Agreatdealoftimecanbespentconverting classroom material into a form that will work in an online environment, but this can really increase workload.Forinstance,PowerPointslideswithoutacommentaryofteneithermissthecriticalcontent, orfailtocovernuancesandemphasis.Thismaymeaneitherusinglecturecapturetorecordthelecture, 631 orhavingtoaddarecordedcommentaryovertheslides atalaterdate.Transferringlecturenotesinto pdffilesandloadingthemupintoalearningmanagementsystemisalsotimeconsuming.However,this is not the best way to develop online materials, both for time management and pedagogical reasons. InStep1Irecommendedrethinkingteaching,notjustmovingrecordedlecturesorclassPowerPoint slides online, but developing materials in ways that enable students to learn better. Now in Step 4 I appear to be contradicting that by suggesting that you should use existing resources. However, the distinction here is between using existing resources that do not transfer well to an online learning environment(suchasa50minuterecordedlecture),andusingmaterialsalreadyspecificallydeveloped or suitable for learning in an online environment. 12.6.2 Use existing online content The Internet, and in particular the World Wide Web, has an immense amount of content already available,andthiswasdiscussedextensivelyinChapter11.Muchofitisfreelyavailableforeducational use,undercertain conditions (e.g. acknowledgement ofthe source–lookfortheCreativeCommons licenseusually attheendofthewebpage).You willfindsuchexisting contentvariesenormouslyin quality and range.

Don’t get drawn into arguments about whether or not it is the best tool. Frankly, in functional terms, there are few important differences between the main LMSs. You may prefertheinterfaceofoneratherthananother,butthiswillbemorethanoverwhelmedbytheamount ofefforttrying touseasystemnotsupportedbyyourinstitution.LMSs arenotperfectbuttheyhave evolvedoverthelast20yearsandingeneralarerelativelyeasytouse,bothbyyouandmoreimportantly bythestudents.Theyprovideausefulframeworkfororganizingyouronlineteaching,andiftheLMSis properlysupportedyoucangethelpwhenneeded.Thereisenoughflexibilityinalearningmanagement systemtoallowyouto teachinavarietyofdifferentways.Inparticular, takethetime tobeproperly trainedinhowtousetheLMS.Acoupleofhoursoftrainingcansaveyoumanyhoursintryingtogetit to work the way you want. A more important question to consider is whether you need to use an LMS at all – but that question should only be considered if the institution is willing to support alternatives, such as WordPressorGoogle Docs, otherwise you could end up spending too much time dealing with pure technology issues. ThesameappliestosynchronouswebtechnologiessuchasBlackboardCollaborate,AdobeConnect, Big Blue Button or ZOOM. I have my preferences but they all do more or less the same thing. The differencesintechnologyarenothingcomparedwiththedifferentwaysinwhichyoucanusethesetools. These are pedagogical or teaching decisions. Focus on these rather than finding the perfect technology. Indeed, think carefully about when it would be best to use synchronous rather than asynchronous online tools. Synchronous tools areuseful when you want to get a group of students together at one time, but such synchronoustoolstend to be instructor-dominated (delivering lectures and controlling the discussion) and require students to be available at a set time. However, you could encourage studentsworkinginsmall teamsonaprojecttouseCollaborateoranothersynchronoustool suchas ZOOM,whichallowsforsettingupsmallsub-groups,todecideroles,discussatopicandformagroup view, or to finalize a project assignment, for instance. On the other hand, asynchronous tools such as an LMS provide learners with more flexibility than synchronous tools, and enable them to work moreindependently(animportantskillforstudents todevelop). Andof coursebothsynchronousand asynchronous tools can be used in conjunction, but that requires working out what each is best for. 12.7.3 Deceptively easy technology Mostofthesetechnologiesaredeceptivelyeasytouse,inthesenseofgettingstarted.Theyhavebeen designedsothatanyonewithoutacomputersciencebackgroundcanusethem.However,overtimethey tendtobecomemoresophisticatedwithawiderangeofdifferentfunctions.Youwon’tneedtouseall thefunctions,butitwillhelpifyouareawarethattheyexist,andwhattheycanandcan’tdo.Ifyoudo want to use a particular feature, it is best to get training so that you can use it quickly and effectively. 12.7.4 Keep current, as far as possible New technologies keep arriving all the time. It is best to focus on new tools that seem functionally differentfromexistingtools, ratherthantrying tocheckevery newsynchronousmeetingsystem,for instance.Itistoodifficultforanysingleteacherorinstructortokeepuptodatewithnewlyemerging technologiesandtheirpossiblerelevanceforteaching.Thisisreallythejobofanywell-runlearning technologysupportunit.Somaketheefforttoattendaonce-a-yearbriefingonnewtechnologies,then follow-up with a further session on any tool that might be of interest. This kind of briefing and training should be provided by the centre or unit that provides learning technologysupport.Ifyourinstitutiondoesnothavesuchaunit,orsuchtraining,thinkverycarefully aboutwhethertousetechnologyextensivelyinyourteaching–eventeachersandinstructorswithalot of experience in using technology for teachingneed such support. Furthermore,newfunctionsareconstantlybeingaddedtoexistingtools.Forinstance,ifyouareusing Moodle,there are‘plug-ins’(such asMahara)thatallowstudents tocreateandmanagetheir owne.portfoliosorelectronicrecordsoftheirwork.

Onetoolisunlikelytodoeverythingyouneedasateacher;awell-chosenmixoftoolsislikelytobe more effective. Keep an open mind and be prepared to make a shift if necessary. 12.7.5 Relate your technology training to how you want to teach There are really two distinct but strongly related components of using technology: • how the technology works; and • what it should be used for. 12.7.5.1 Focus on the learning outcomes Thesearetoolsbuilttoassistyou,soyouhavetobeclearastowhatyouaretryingtoachievewiththe tools.Thisisaninstructionalorpedagogicalissue.Thusifyouwanttofindwaystoengagestudents,or togivethempracticeindevelopingskills,suchassolvingquadraticequations,learnwhatthestrengths orweaknessesareofthevarioustechnologiesfordoingthis(seeChapter7andChapter8formoreon this). This issomewhat of an iterative process.When a new tool or a new feature is beingdescribed or demonstrated,thinkofhowthismightfitwithorfacilitateoneofyourteachinggoals.Butalsobeopen topossiblychangingyourgoalsormethodstotakeadvantageofatoolinenablingyoutodosomething you had not thought of doing before.

In many trades and vocational areas, industry training boards or employers’ associations set learning goals or desired outcomes or competencies that need to be followed for qualifications to be accredited. Even in a university, an instructor(particularlyacontractinstructororadjunct)may‘inherit’acoursewherethegoalsarealready set, either by a previous instructor or by the academic department. Nevertheless,thereremainmanycontextswhereteachersandinstructorshaveadegreeofcontrolover thegoalsofaparticularcourseorprogram.Inparticular,anewcourseorprogram–suchasanonline mastersprogramaimedatworkingprofessionals–offersanopportunitytoreconsiderdesiredlearning outcomesandgoals.Especiallywherecurriculumisframedmainlyin termsofcontenttobecovered ratherthanbyskillstobedeveloped,theremaystillberoomformanoeuvreinsettinglearninggoalsthat wouldalsoinclude,forinstance,intellectualskillsdevelopment.Inothercontexts,thedevelopmentor focusmaybeonmoreaffectiveskills,suchassympathyorempathy,oronthedevelopmentofmanual or operational skills. 641 12.8.2 Learning goals for a digital age InChapter 1, Section 2, I listeda number of skillsthat learners will need in a digital age, including: • modern communication skills; • independent learning; • ethics and responsibility; • teamwork and flexibility; • thinking skills including: . critical thinking; . problem solving; . creative thinking; . strategising and planning; • digital skills; • knowledge management. Theseareexamplesofthekindsofgoalthatneedtobeidentified.Moretraditionalgoalsmightalsobe included,suchascomprehensionandapplicationofspecificareasofcontent.Thesegoalsoroutcomes mightbeexpressedintermsofBloom’staxonomy(1956)ortheRoyalBankofCanada’s(2018)orina varietyofotherways.Alltheseskillsneedtobeembeddedorbuiltwithintheneedsofaspecificsubject domain.Inotherwords,theyareskillsthatneedtobespecifictoasubjectarearatherthangeneral.At thesametime,studentswhodevelopsuchskillswithinanyparticularsubjectareawillbebetterprepared for a digital age. Yourlistofgoalsforacoursemay–indeed,shouldbe–differentfrommine,butitwillbeessential todothekindofanalysisrecommendedinStep1(decidinghowyouwanttoteach),andthentodecide on what thelearning goals should be, based on: • your understanding of the needs of the students; • the needs of the the subject domain; • the demandsof the external world. Ihaveplacedaparticularemphasisonthedevelopmentofintellectualskills.Aswithalllearninggoals, theteachingneedstobedesignedinsuchawaythatstudentshaveopportunitiestolearnandpractice suchskills,andinparticular,suchskillsneedtobeevaluatedaspartoftheformalassessmentprocess. Perhapsmorechallengingistoidentifywhatyouwillbeaddingtogeneralskillsdevelopmentsuchas criticalthinking.Whatisthelevelofcriticalthinkingskillsthatstudentswillcomewith,andhowdo Imakesuretheyprogressintheirabilityinthisskillduringthecourse?Thisemphasisesthevalueof havinglearningoutcomesclearlyidentifiedforawholeprogram,perhapsusingacurriculummapping tool such asDaedalus. WhatthismeansintermsofcoursedesignisusingtheInternetincreasinglyasamajorresourcefor learning, giving students more responsibility for finding and evaluating information themselves, and instructorsprovidingcriteriaandguidelinesforfinding,evaluating,analysingandapplyinginformation within a specific knowledge domain.

Something made up of a number of parts that are held or put together in a particular way. 2.The way in which parts are arranged or put together to form a whole 3. The interrelation or arrangement of parts in a complex entity. Teaching structure would include two critical and related elements: • the choice, breakdown and sequencing of the curriculum(content); • the deliberate organization of student activities by teacher or instructor (skills development; and assessment). Thismeansthatinastrongteachingstructure,studentsknowexactlywhattheyneedtolearn,whatthey aresupposedtodotolearnthis,andwhenandwheretheyaresupposedtodoit.Inaloosestructure, studentactivityismoreopenandlesscontrolledbytheteacher(althoughastudentmayindependently decidetoimposehisorherown‘strong’structureontheirlearning).Thechoiceofteachingstructureof course has implications for the work of teachers and instructors as well as students. Intermsofthedefinition,‘strong’teachingstructureisnotinherentlybetterthana‘loose’structure, norinherentlyassociatedwitheitherface-to-faceoronlineteaching.Thechoice(assoofteninteaching) willdependonthespecificcircumstances.However,choosingtheoptimumormostappropriateteaching structure is critical for quality teaching andlearning, and while the optimum structures for online teachingsharemanycommonfeatureswithface-to-faceteaching,inotherwaystheydifferconsiderably. The three main determinants of teaching structure are: (a) the organizational requirements of the institution; (b)the preferred philosophy of teaching of the instructor; (c) the instructor’s perception of the needs of the students. 12.9.2Institutional organizational requirements of face-to-face teaching Althoughtheinstitutional structureinface-to-faceteachingis sofamiliarthatitisoftenunnoticed or taken for granted, institutional requirements are in fact a major determinant of the way teaching is structured,aswellasinfluencingboththeworkofteachersandthelifeofstudents.Ilistbelowsome oftheinstitutionalrequirementsthatinfluencethestructureofface-to-faceteachinginpost-secondary education: • the minimum number of years of study required for a degree; • the program approval and review process; • the number of credits required for a degree; • the relationship between credits and contact time in the class; • the length of a semester and its relationship to credit hours; • instructor:student ratios; • the availability of classroom or laboratory spaces; • time and location of examinations. Thereareprobablymanymore.Therearesimilarinstitutionalorganizationalrequirementsintheschool system,includingthelengthoftheschoolday, thetimingofholidays, and soon.(To understandthe somewhatbizarrereasonswhytheCarnegieUnitbasedonaStudentStudyHourcametobeadoptedin the USA, seeWikipedia.) As our campus-based institutions have increased in size, so have the institutional organizational requirements ‘solidified’. Without this structure it would become even more difficult to deliver consistent teaching services across the institution. Also such organizational consistency across institutions is necessary for purposes of accountability, accreditation, government funding, credit transfer, admission to graduate school, and a host of other reasons. Thus there are strong systemic reasonswhytheseorganizationalrequirementsofface-to-faceteachingaredifficultifnotimpossibleto change, at least at the institutional level. Thusanyteacherisfacedbyanumberofmassiveconstraints.Inparticular,thecurriculumneedstofit withinthetime‘units’available,suchasthelengthofthesemesterandthenumberofcreditsandcontact hoursforaparticularcourse.Theteachinghastotakeintoaccountclasssizeandclassroomavailability. Students(andteachersandinstructors)have tobeatspecificplaces(classrooms,examinationrooms, laboratories) at specific times. Thus despite the concept of academic freedom, the structure of face-to-face teaching is to a large extentalmostpredeterminedbyinstitutionalandorganizationalrequirements.Iamtemptedtodigress to question the suitability of such structural limitations for the needs of learners in a digital age, or towonderwhetherfacultyunionswouldacceptsuchrestrictions onacademicfreedomiftheydidnot alreadyexist,buttheaimhereistoidentifywhichoftheseorganizationalconstraintsapplyalsotoonline learning, and which do not, because this will influence how we can structure teaching activities. 12.9.3Institutional organizational requirements of online teaching Oneobviouschallengeforonlinelearning,atleastinitsearliestdays,wasacceptance.Therewas(and stillis)alotofskepticismaboutthequalityandeffectivenessofonlinelearning,especiallyfromthose thathaveneverstudiedortaughtonline.Soinitiallyalotofeffortwentintodesigningonlinelearning withthesamegoalsandstructuresasface-to-faceteaching,todemonstratethatonlineteachingwas‘as good as’ face-to-face teaching (which, research suggests, itis). However, this meant accepting the same course, credit and semester assumptions of face-to-face teaching.Itshouldbenotedthoughthatasfarbackas1971,theUKOpenUniversityoptedforadegree program structure that was roughly equivalent in total study time to a regular, campus-based degree program,butwhichwasneverthelessstructuredverydifferently,forinstance,withfullcreditcoursesof 32weeks’studyandhalfcreditcoursesof16weeks’study.Onereasonwastoenableintegrated,multi.disciplinaryfoundationcourses.TheWesternGovernors’University,withitsemphasisoncompetency.basedlearning,andEmpireStateCollegeinNewYorkState,withitsemphasis onlearningcontracts foradultlearners,areotherexamplesofinstitutionsthathavedifferentstructuresforteachingfromthe norm. Ifonlinelearningprogramsaimtobeatleastequivalenttoface-to-faceprograms,thentheyarelikely toadoptatleasttheminimumlengthofstudyforaprogram(e.g.fouryearsforabachelor’sdegreein NorthAmerica),the samenumberoftotalcreditsfor adegree,andhenceimplicitinthisisthe same amount of study time as for face-to-face programs. Where the same structure begins to break down thoughisincalculating‘contacttime’,whichbydefinitionisusuallythenumberofhoursofclassroom instruction.Thusa13week,3creditcourse isroughlyequaltothreehoursaweekofclassroomtime over one semester of 13 weeks. Therearelotsofproblemswiththisconceptof‘contacthours’,whichneverthelessisthestandard measuringunitforface-to-faceteaching.Studyatapost-secondarylevel,andparticularlyinuniversities, requires much more than just turning up to lectures. A common estimate is that for every hour of classroomtime,studentsspendaminimumofanothertwohoursonreadings,assignments,etc.Contact hoursvaryenormouslybetweendisciplines,withusuallyarts/humanitieshavingfarlesscontacthours than engineering or science students, who spend a much larger proportion of time in labs. Another limitation of ‘contact hours’ is that it measures input, not output. When we moveto blended orhybrid learning, wemay retain the samesemester structure, butthe ‘contacthour’modelstartstobreakdown.Studentsmayspendtheequivalentofonlyonehouraweek in class, andthe rest online – or maybe 15 hours in labs one week, and none the rest of the semester. A better principle would beto ensure that the students in blended, hybrid or fully online courses or programs work to the same academic standardsas the face-to-face students, or rather, spend the equivalent ‘notional’ time on doing a course or getting a degree. This means structuring the courses or programs in such a way that students have the equivalent amount of work to do, whether it is online,blendedorface-to-face.However,thewaythatworkwillbedistributedcanveryconsiderably, depending on the mode of delivery. 12.9.4How much work is an online course? Before decisions can be made about the best way to structure ablended or anonline course, some assumptionneedstobemadeabouthowmuchtimestudentsshouldexpecttostudyonthecourse.We haveseenthatthisreallyneedstobeequivalenttowhatafull-timestudentwouldstudy.However,just takingtheequivalentnumberofcontacthoursfortheface-to-faceversiondoesn’tallowforalltheother time face-to-face students spend studying. Areasonableestimateisthatathreecreditundergraduatecourseisroughlyequivalenttoabout8-9 hoursstudyaweek,oratotalofroughly100hoursover13weeks.(Afull-timestudentthentaking10x 3creditsayear,withfive3creditcoursespersemester,wouldbestudyingbetween40-45hoursaweek during the two semesters, or slightly less if the studying continued over the inter-semester period.). Nowthisismyguideline.Youdon’thavetoagreewithit.Youmaythinkthisistoomuchortoolittle foryoursubject.Thatdoesn’tmatter.Youdecidethetime.Theimportantpointthoughisthatyouhave afairlyspecifictargetoftotaltimethatshouldbespentonacourseorprogrambyanaveragestudent, knowingthatsomewillreachthesamestandardmorequicklyandothersmoreslowly.Thistotalstudent studytimefor aparticularchunkofstudysuch asacourseorprogramprovides alimitorconstraint withinwhichyoumuststructurethelearning.Itisalsoagoodideatomakeitcleartostudentsfromthe start how much time each week you are expecting them to work on the course. Sincethereisfar morecontentthatcouldbeputin acoursethanstudentswillhavetime tostudy, thisusually meanschoosingtheminimum amountofcontentforthe courseforit tobeacademically sound,whilestillallowingstudentstimeforactivitiessuchasindividualresearch,assignmentsorproject work.Ingeneral,becauseinstructorsareexpertsin asubjectandstudents arenot,thereisatendency forinstructors tounderestimatethe amountofworkrequiredby astudenttocoveratopic.Again, an instructional designer can be useful here, providing a second opinion on student workload. 12.9.5Strong or loose structure? Anothercriticaldecisionisjusthowmuchyoushould structurethecourseforthestudents.Thiswill depend partly on your preferred teaching philosophy and partly on the needs of the students. Ifyouhaveastrongviewofthecontentthatmustbecoveredinaparticularcourse,andthesequence in which it must be presented (or if you are given a mandated curriculum by an accrediting body), thenyouarelikelytowanttoprovideaverystrongstructure,withspecifictopicsassignedforstudyat particular points in the course, with student work or activities tightly linked. Ifontheotherhandyoubelieveitispartofthestudent’sresponsibilitytomanageandorganizetheir study,orifyouwanttogivestudentssomechoiceaboutwhattheystudyandtheorderinwhichtheydo it, so long as they meet the learning goals for the course, then you are likely to opt for a loose structure. Thisdecisionshouldalsobeinfluencedbythetypeofstudentsyou areteaching.Ifstudents come without independent learning skills, or know nothing about the subject area, they will need a strong structuretoguidetheirstudies,atleastinitially.Ifontheotherhandtheyarefourthyearundergraduates orgraduatestudentswithahighdegreeofself-management,thenalooserstructuremaybemoresuitable to their needs.

Indeed, it may be possible to structure a course in such a way that different students could work at different speeds. Competency-based learning means that students can work through the same course or program at very different speeds. Some open universities even have continuousenrolment,sotheycanstartandfinishatdifferenttimes.Moststudentsoptingforanonline coursearelikelytobeworking,soyoumayneedtoallowthemlongertocompleteacoursethanfull.timestudents.Forinstance,ifon-campusmastersprogramsneedtobecompletedinoneortwoyears, students may need up to five years to complete anonline professional masters program. 12.9.9 Key principles in structuring a course Now there may be good reasons for not doing some of these things, but this will be because of pedagogicalratherthaninstitutional organizational reasons.Forinstance,I’m notkeenoncontinuous enrollment,orself-pacedinstruction,becauseespecially atgraduatelevelImakeheavy useofonline discussionforumsandonlinegroupwork.Ilikestudentstoworkthroughacourseatroughlythesame pace, because it leads to more focused discussions, and organizing group work when students are at differentpointsinthecourseisdifficultifnotimpossible.However,inothercourses,forinstanceamath course, self-paced instruction may make a lot of sense. Iwill discuss other non-traditional course structures when we discuss student activities below. However you structure the course, though, two basic principles remain: • there must be some notional idea of how much time students should spend each week on the course; • students should be clear each week about what they have to do and when it needs to be done. 12.9.10Designing student activities This is the most critical part of the design process, especially for fully online students, who have neither the regular classroom structure or campus environment for contact with the instructor and other students nor the opportunity for spontaneous questions and discussions in a face-to-face class. Regular student activities though are critical for keeping all students engaged and on task, irrespective of mode of delivery. These can include: • assigned readings,with some activity that enables students to demonstrate their understanding; • simple multiple choice self-assessment tests of understanding with automated feedback, using the computer-based testing facility within a learning management system; • questions requiring short paragraph answers which may be shared with other students for comparison or discussion; • formally marked and assessed monthly assignments in the form of short essays or reports; • individual or group project work spaced over several weeks; • an individual student blog or e-portfolio that enables the student to reflect on their recent learning, and which may be shared with the instructor or other students; • online discussion forums, which the instructor will need to organize and monitor. There are many other activities that instructors can devise to keep students engaged. However, all such activities need to be clearly linked to the stated learning outcomes for the course and can be seen by students as helping them prepare for any formal assessment. If learning outcomes are focused on skills development, then the activities should be designed to give students opportunities to develop or practice such skills. These activities also need to be regularly spaced and an estimate made of the time students will need to complete the activities. In step eight,we shall see that student engagement in such activities will need to be monitored by the instructor. It is at this point where some hard decisions may need to be made about the balance between ‘content’ and ‘activities’. Students must have enough time to do regular activities (other than just reading) once each week at least, or their risk of dropping out or failing the course will increase dramatically. In particular they will need some way of getting feedback or comments on their activities, either from the instructor or from other students, so the design of the course will have to take account of the instructors’ workload as well as the students’. In my view, most university and college courses are overstuffed with content and not enough consideration is given to what students need to do to absorb, apply and evaluate such content. I have a very rough rule of thumb that students should spend no more than half their time reading content and attending lectures, the rest being spent on interpreting, analyzing, or applying that content through the kinds of activities listed above. As students become more mature and more self-managed the proportion of time spent on activities can increase, with the students themselves being responsible for identifying appropriate content that will enable them to meet the goals and criteria laid down by the instructor. However, that is my personal view. Whatever your teaching philosophy though, there must be plenty of activities with some form of feedback for online students, or they will drop like flies on a cold winter’s day. 12.9.11Many structures, one high standard There are many other ways to ensure an appropriate structure for an online course. For instance, the Carnegie MellonOpen Learning Initiativeprovides a complete course ‘in a box’ for standard first and second year courses in two year colleges. These include alearning management system sitewith content, objectives and activities pre-loaded, with an accompanying textbook. The content is carefully structured, with in-built student activities. The instructors’ role is mainly delivery, providing student feedback and marking where needed. These courses have proved to be veryeffective, in that most students successfully complete such programs. The History instructor inScenario Dkept a normal three lectures a week structure for the first three weeks, then students worked entirely online in small groupson a major project for fiveweeks, then returned to class for one three-hour session a week for five weeks for students to report back on and discuss their projects as a whole class group. We saw that incompetency-based learning,students can work at their own speed through highly structured courses academically, in terms of topic sequences and learner activities, that nevertheless have flexibility in the time students can take to successfully complete a competency. TheIntegrated Science Programat McMaster University is built around6-10 week undergraduate research projects. cMOOC’s such as Stephen Downes, George Siemen’s, and Dave Cormier’s#Change 11(Milligan, 2012) have a loose structure, with different topics with different contributors each week, but student activities, such as blog posts or comments, are not organized by the course designers butleft to the students. However, these are not credit courses, and few students work all the way through the whole MOOC, and that is not their intent. The Stanford and MIT xMOOC’s on the other hand are highly structured, with student activities, andthe feedback is fully automated. Less than 10per centof students who start these MOOCs successfully complete them, but they too are non-credit courses. Increasingly MOOCs are becoming shorter, some of as little as three or four weeks in length. Online learning enables teachers and instructors to break away from a rigidthree semester, 13 week, three lectures a week structure, and build courses around structures that best meet the needs of learners and the preferred teaching method of the teacher or instructor.My aim in a credit course or program is to ensure high academic qualityand high completion rates. For me that means developing an appropriate structure and related learning activities as a key step in achieving quality in credit online courses. References Means,B.etal.(2010)Evaluation of Evidence-Based Practices in Online Learning: A Meta-Analysis and Review of Online Learning Studies Washington, DC: US Department of Education Milligan, C.

If not, how would you structure such a program, and why? 3. Do you think most credit courses are ‘overstuffed’ with content and do not have enough learning activities? Do we focus too much on content and not enough on skills development in higher education? How does that affect the structure of courses? How much does it affect the quality of the learning? Again, no feedback provided on this activity. 12.10Step eight: communicate, communicate, communicate Figure 12.10.1 Communicate!

You should actively encourage discussion by being ‘present’ and steppinginonadiscussionwherenecessary–forinstanceifthecommentsaregettingofftopicortoo personal. 12.10.4 Teaching philosophy and online communication Instructors who have a more objectivist approach to teaching are more likely to focus on whether studentsarenotonlycoveringthenecessarycontent butarealsounderstandingit.Thisoftenrequires studentsgoingbackovercontent,providingmisunderstoodordifficultcontentinanalternativemanner (e.g. a video as well as text), and instructor or automated (computer-based) feedback. Most LMSs will provide summaries of student activities, and it is important to track each individual student’s progress.Instructorswithamoreconstructivistapproacharemorelikelytoemphasizeonlinediscussion and argument. Whateveryourapproach,studentswanttoknowwhereyoustandonsomeofthetopics.Thuswhile itisnecessaryoftentopresentcontentobjectivelywithan‘ontheonehand…ontheother…’approach, students usually feel more committed to a course where the instructor’s own views or approach to a topic are made clear. This can be done in a variety of ways, such as a podcast on a topic, or an interventionin adiscussion,orashortvideoofhowyouwouldgoaboutsolving anequation.These personalinterventionshavetobecarefullyjudged,butcanmakeabigdifferencetostudentcommitment and participation. 12.10.5Choice of medium for instructor communication Thereisnowawidevarietyofmediabywhichinstructorscancommunicatewithstudents,orstudents can communicate with each other. Basically, though, they fall into fourcategories: • face-to-face, such as set office hours, scheduled classes or serendipity (bumping into each other in the corridor); • synchronous communication media,including voice phone calls, text and audio conferencing over the web (for example, Blackboard Collaborate), or even video-conferencing (for example, ZOOM); • asynchronouscommunication media,including e-mail, podcasts or recorded video clips, and online discussion forums within an LMS; • social media, such as blogs, wikis, text or voice messages on mobile phones, Facebook and Twitter. In general, I much prefer asynchronous communication for two reasons. Students are often working and have busy lives; asynchronous discussion, questions and answers are more convenient for them. Asynchronouscommunicationscanbeaccessedatanytime.Also,theyaremuchmoreconvenientfor measaninstructor.ForinstanceIcangotoaconferenceeveninanothercountryyetstilllogontomy coursewhenIhavesomefreetime.IalsohavearecordofwhatIhavesaidtostudents.IfusinganLMS, it is password protected and communications can be kept within the class group. However,asynchronouscommunicationcanbefrustratingforstudentswhencomplexdecisionsneed to be made within a tight timescale, such as deciding the roles and responsibilities for group work, thefinaldraftofagroupassignment,orastudent’slackofunderstandingthatisblockinganyfurther progress on the topic. Then face-to-face or technology-based synchronous communication is better, depending on whether it is a blended or fully online course. Inafullyonlinecourse,IalsosometimesuseaconferencingsystemsuchasBlackboardCollaborate or ZOOM to bring all the students together once or twice during a semester, to get a feeling of communityatthestartofacourse,toestablishmy‘presence’asarealpersonwithafaceorvoiceatthe startofacourse,ortowrapupacourseattheend,andItrytoprovideplentyofopportunityforquestions anddiscussionbythestudentsthemselves.However,thesesynchronous‘lectures’arealwaysoptional astherewillalwaysbesomestudentswhocannotbepresent(althoughtheycanbemadeavailablein recorded format). Forablendedcourse,though,Iwouldorganiseaseriesofrelativelysmallface-to-facegroupsessions inthefirstorsecondweekofacourse,sostudentscangettoknoweachotheraswellasme,thenkeep them in the same groups for any group work or discussions. Blogsore-portfolioscanbeusedbystudentstorecordtheirlearningortoreflectonwhattheyhave learned,andblogs canbeausefulwayfortheinstructor tocommentonnewsoreventsrelevanttoa course,butcareisneededtokeepaclearseparationbetweenstudents’privatelivesandconversations, and the more formal in-class communications. 12.10.6Managing online discussion Whole books have been written on this topic (see Salmon, 2000, Paloff and Pratt, 2007; Harasim, 2017)and this is discussed in detail inChapter 4, Section 4.4.4. However, there are some basic guidelines to follow. 12.10.6.1Threaded discussion Usethethreaded discussion forumfacilityintheLMS(insomeLMSstheinstructorhastochooseto switch this on). Figure12.10.2Exampleofathreadeddiscussiontopic.ThisisanoldLMS(WebCT)butillustrates clearly the value of a threaded discussion. Although LMSs are losing some of their original appeal, with more and more instructors using WordPressorothercontentmanagementsystems,IliketousetheLMSforumdiscussiontoolbecauseI can organize the discussion by separate topics (a forum for each topic). Inathreadeddiscussion,astudentcommentonsomeoneelse’spostonatopicispostednexttothe post,allowingeitherthestudentmakingtheoriginalpostorotherstudentstorespondtothecomment.

However, even if all the students are within one hour’s commute of the institution, they will have different learning styles and approaches to studying online. This is why it is important to be clear about the desired learning outcomes, and the goals for discussion forums. Students learn in different ways. If one of the desired learning outcomes is critical thinking, students can achieve that in different ways. Some may prefer to discuss course issues with other students over a coffee. Some may do a lot of reading, seeking out different viewpoints. Others may prefer to work mainly in the online discussion forums. Some students learn a lot by lurking online but never contribute directly. Now if you are trying to improve international students’ language skills, then you may require them to participate in the online discussions, and will assess them on their contributions. However, I try not force students to participate. I see it as my challenge to make the topic interesting enough to draw them in.I don’t really care how they achieve the learning outcomes so long as they do. Having said that, much can be done to facilitate or encourage students to participate. I taught one graduate course where I had about 20 of the 30 students in my class with Chinese surnames. From the student records and the short bios they posted I noted that a few students were from the Chinese mainland, several more were living in Hong Kong, and the rest had Canadian addresses. However even the latter consisted of two quite different groups: recent immigrants to Canada, and at least one student whose great grandfather had been one of the first immigrants to Canada in the 19th century. Although it is dangerous to rely on stereotypes, I noticed that the further away ‘psychologically’ or geographically the student was, the less they were initially inclined to participate online. This was partly a language issue but also a cultural issue. The mainland Chinese in particular were very reluctant to post comments. Fortunately we had a visiting Chinese scholar with us and she advised us to get the three mainland Chinese women on the course to develop a collective contribution to the discussion and then ask them to send it to me to check that it was ‘appropriate’ before they posted. I made a few comments then sent it back and they then posted it. Gradually by the end of the course they each had the confidence to post individually their owncomments.But it was a difficult process for them. (On the other hand, I had Mexican students who commented on everything, whether it was about the course or not, and especially about the World Cup soccer tournament that was on at the time). Students differences (and possibly stereotypes) also change over time. I am not sure whether 20 that different students respond differently to online discussion and the instructor needs sensitivity to these differences, and strategies to ensure participation from everyone. 12.10.8Conclusion Thisisabigtopicanddifficulttocoveradequatelyinonesection.However,theimportanceofinstructor presence cannot be overemphasized forgetting students successfully to complete any course with an online component. The lack of instructor online presence in xMOOCs is one reason so few students complete the courses. There is an unlimited number of ways in which you, as an instructor, can communicate now with students,butitisalsoessentialatthesametimetocontrolyourworkload.Youcannotbeavailable24.7, andthismeansdesigningtheonlinedeliveryinsuchawaythatyour‘presence’isusedtobesteffect.At thesametime,communicationwithonlinestudentscanendupbeingthemostinterestingandsatisfying part of teaching. References and further reading (This is just a small sample of many publications on this topic,) Anderson, T., Rourke, L., Garrison, R., & Archer, W.

We should be aiming for completionratesofatleast85percent,whichmeansof100studentsstartingthecourse,85completeby passingtheendofcourseassessment(unfortunately,manycurrentcoursesfailtoachievethisrate,butif we value good teaching, we should be trying to bring as many students as possible to the set standard). Thesecondcriterionis tocomparethegrades.We wouldexpect atleast asmanyAsandBsinour newversionasintheoldclassroomversion,whilemaintainingthesame(hopefullyhigh)standardsor higher. However,tobevalidtheevaluationwillalsowouldneedtodefinetheknowledgeandskillswithina coursethatmeettheneedsofadigitalage,thenmeasuringhoweffectivetheteachingwasindoingthis. Thus athird criterion would be: • the new design(s) will lead to new and different learning outcomes that are more relevant to the needs of a digital age. This third criterion is more difficult, because it suggests a change in the intended learning goals for coursesorprograms.Thismightincludeassessingstudents’communicationskillswithnewmedia,or their ability tofind,evaluate, analyzeand applyinformationappropriatelywithinthesubject domain (knowledge management), which have not previously been (adequately)assessed in the classroom version.Thisrequiresaqualitativejudgement astowhichlearninggoalsaremostimportant,andthis may require endorsement or support from a departmental curriculum committee or even an external accreditation body. With a new design, and new learning outcomes, it may be difficult to reach these standards immediately, but over two or three years it should be possible. 12.11.3 What to evaluate: formative However, even if we measure the course by these three criteria, we will not necessarily know what workedandwhatdidn’tinthecourse.Weneedtolookmorecloselyatfactorsthatmayhaveinfluenced students’abilitytolearn.Wehavelaidoutinsteps1-8someofthesefactors.Someofthequestionsfor which you may want answers are as follows: • Were the learning outcomes or goals clear to students? • What learning outcomes did most students struggle with? • Was the teaching material clear and well structured? • Were the learning materials and tools students needed easilyaccessible and available 24 x 7? • What topics generated good discussion and what didn’t? • Did students draw appropriately on the course materials in their discussion forums or assignments? • Did students find their own appropriate sources and use them well in discussions, assignments and other student activities? • Which student activities worked well, and which badly? Why? • What of the supplied learning materials did students make most and least use of? • Did the assignments adequately assess the knowledge and skills the course was aiming to teach? • Were the students overloaded with work? • Was it too much work for me as an instructor? • If so, what could I do to better manage my workload (or the students’) without losing quality? • How satisfied were the students with the course? • How satisfied am Iwith the course? Iwillnowsuggestsomewaysthatthesequestionscanbeansweredwithoutagaincausingahugeamount of work. 12.11.4 How to evaluate factors contributing to or inhibiting learning Thereisarangeofresourcesyoucandrawontodothis,muchmoreinfactthanforevaluatingtraditional face-to-face courses, because online learning leaves a traceable digital trail of evidence: • student grades; • individual student participation rates in online activities, such as self-assessment questions, discussion forums, podcasts; • qualitative analysis of the discussion forums, for instance the quality and range of comments, indicating the level or depth of engagement or thinking; • student e-portfolios, assignments and exam answers; • student questionnaires; • focus groups. However,beforestarting,itisusefultodrawupalistofquestionsasintheprevioussection,andthen look at which sources are most likely to provide answers to those questions. Figure 12.11.2 Analysis of a sample of exam answers will often provide information about course structure and the presentation of materials Attheendofacourse,Itendtolookatthestudentgrades,andidentifywhichstudentsdidwelland whichstruggled.Thisdependsofcourseonthenumberofstudentsinaclass.InalargeclassImight samplebygrades.Ithengobacktothebeginningofthecourseandtracktheironlineparticipationasfar aspossible(learninganalyticsmakethismucheasier,althoughitcanalsobedonemanuallyifalearning managementsystemisused).Ifindthatsomefactorsarestudentspecific(e.g.agregariousstudentwho communicateswitheveryone)andsomearecoursefactorspecific,forexample,relatedtolearninggoals orthewayIhaveexplainedorpresentedcontent.Thisqualitativeapproachwilloftensuggestchanges tothecontentorthewayIinteractedwithstudentsforthenextversionofthecourse.Imayforinstance determine next time to manage more carefully students who ‘hog’ the conversation. Many institutions have a ‘standard’ student reporting system at the end of each course.

Where an earth will you find thetimetobecomeexpertinteachingifthismeanscompletelychangingtheteachingmodelyouhave become comfortable with? You are not alone in thinking this. Martha Cleveland-Innes (2013) writes: It is unrealistic to expect higher education faculty to have sound, current, content expertise, a productive research program, an active service commitment AND be expert online teachers. The biggest lie in the academy is that the role of faculty, and its rewards and responsibilities, is made up of a seemingly balanced set of activities around teaching, research and service (Atkinson, 2001). With some variation across type of institution, research is the most valued work and most notably 679 rewarded. While this reality has not changed “…classroom teaching and course materials (have become) more sophisticated and complex in ways that translate into new forms of faculty work. ….. such new forms are not replacing old ones, but instead are layered on top of them, making for more work.” (Rhoades, 2000, p, 38). It is time to clarify this reality and consider how, if at all, changes in teaching are, or may be, integrated into the role of faculty member. Howchangesmaybeintegratedintotheroleoffacultymember,instructororclassroomteacherina digitalageiswhatthischapterisabout.Itisnot realistictoexpectallteacherstobesuper-heroes(even ifyouaretheexception),butitis realistictoexpectallteacherstobecompetentandprofessionalina digital age. Thegoodnewsthoughisthatifyouhavereadyourwaythroughallthechaptersinthisbook,youwill havedonewhatyouneedtodotobecompetentandprofessionalforteachinginadigitalage,andwill certainlybeaheadof99percentofyourcolleaguesonthis(atleastuntiltheyhavealsoreadthisbook).

Indeed, post-graduate students interested in experimenting with learning technologies or taking professional courses or programsinteachingareoftendeliberatelydiscouragedbytheirsupervisorsfromdoingso,asitwould 681 detract from their research. Increased use of adjunct/contract facultyexacerbates the problem (see Chapter 13.4). Being on contract, they require payment for any training, but institutions are often reluctanttotraincontractworkerswhomaythenleaveattheendofthecontractandtaketheirtraining and skills to a competitor. Thesituationissomewhatdifferentin twoyearcolleges.Manyjurisdictions(butby nomeansall) havearegional,state orprovincialInstructorDiplomaProgramthat somecollegesrequireinstructors totakeonappointmentorshortlyafterwards.However,manyoftheseprogramshavenotbeenadapted to take account of online learning, and probably none are yet up to date on blended learning. I was anexternalreviewerforonesuchprogramawhileago,andtherewasalmostnomentionofonlineor blended learning. Most of the technologies discussed in this program wereat least 20 years old. Thelack ofcomprehensive andsystematic training atapre-service level places a disproportionate burden on ongoing professional development, which is at best ad hoc and variable in both quantity andquality. Aboveall,itis anentirelyvoluntarysystem –inotherwords,teachers orinstructorscan choose not to take any in-service workshops or courses on teaching, if they decide – as most do – thattheirprofessionaldevelopmenttimewillbebetterspentfocusingonresearchratherthanteaching. ChristensenHughesandMighty(2010)arguethatlessthan10percentofalluniversityinstructorstake professionaldevelopmentactivitiesfocusedonimprovingtheirteaching,andthefacultythatdooptin are often those in least need of training as they are often already excellent teachers. Lastly,mostfacultyandinstructorsdonotbasetheirteachingpracticeonempirically-basedevidence orresearchontheeffectivenessofdifferentapproaches.ChristensenHughesandMighty(2010)have editedacollectionofstudiesonresearchonteachingandlearninginhighereducation.Intheopening chapter the editors state: …researchers have discovered much about teaching and learning in higher education, but that dissemination and uptake of this information have been limited. As such, the impact of educational research on faculty-teaching practice and student-learning experience has been negligible. In the same book, Christopher Knapper (also of Queens University) states (p. 229-230): There is increasing empirical evidence from a variety of international settings that prevailing teaching practices in higher education do not encourage the sort of learning that contemporary society demands….Teaching remains largely didactic, assessment of student work is often trivial, and curricula are more likely to emphasize content coverage than acquisition of lifelong and life-wide skills…. [However] there is an impressive body of evidence on how teaching methods and curriculum design affect deep, autonomous and reflective learning. Yet most faculty are largely ignorant of this scholarship, and instructional practices are dominated by tradition rather than research evidence. Thisbookhasshownthatwedonothavetoinventordiscoverwhat’sneededtoteachwellinadigital age.Thereisawell-establishedliteratureandgenerallyagreedbestpractices,yet,asChristensenHughes andMightyhavepointedout,manyifnotamajorityofteachersandinstructorsareunawareorcontinue to ignore these standards. 13.2.3 Why the system needs to change When university education was limited to an elite few students, where faculty had a close, one-on.one relationship with students, it was possible to manage quite effectively without formal training in teaching. That is not the case today. Faculty are challenged by large classes, and heterogeneous students who learn in a variety of ways, with different learning skills and abilities. The emphasis is changingfromknowledgeascontenttoknowledgeasprocess.Teachingmethodsneedtobechosenthat willdeveloptheskillsandcompetenciesneededin aknowledge-basedsociety, andontopofallthis, constantlychangingtechnologyrequiresinstructors tohaveanalyticalframeworks tohelpchooseand use technologies appropriately for teaching. Inparticular, theprofoundeffectoftheInternet onscholarship,research,workandleisurerequires major reconsideration of our teaching methods, if we are to develop the skills and knowledge our studentswillneedinaknowledge-basedsociety.Thisrequirescomprehensiveandsystematictraining ofourinstructors,notasystemthatdependsheavily onopting-in,andthatfails torewardadequately excellence in teaching as measured by the standards required in today’s context. Movingtoblended,hybridandonlinelearningrequiresamuchhigherstandardoftrainingforfaculty and instructors. It is not just a question of learning how to use a learning management system or an iPad.The useoftechnologyneeds tobecombinedwith anunderstandingofhowstudentslearn,how skills are developed, how knowledge is represented through different media and then processed, and howlearnersusedifferentsensesforlearning.Itmeansexaminingdifferentapproachestolearning,such astheconstructionofknowledgecomparedwithatransmissionmodelofteaching,andhowtechnology best works with either approach. Above all, it means linking the use of technology to the specific requirements of a particular knowledge domain or subject area. The expansion into blended and online learning has been facilitated mainly by the establishment of separate learning technology support units to support faculty and instructors who do not have the experience or skills to teach online. Although this is essential, it will be prohibitively expensive to continue to expand such units as blended and online learning continues to grow (Bates and Sangrà, 2011). It is much more cost-effective to provide adequate initial pre-service training so that learning technologyunitscanconcentrateontraining,professionaldevelopmentandR&Dintonewmethodsof teaching and learning as new technologies develop. 13.2.4What needs to be done Identifyingtheproblemismucheasierthanfixingit.Inparticular,thecultureespeciallyofuniversities protectsthe existingsystem.Academic freedomisoftenused asan argument for the status quo,and unionsinthecollegesysteminsistonpaymentforinstructorsforanytimespentontrainingoverand above their normal teaching load. As Bates and Sangrà (2011) have pointed out, this is a systemic problem.Itisdifficultforauniversity,forexample,tochangeforfearthattheirbestyoungresearchers willmove to another institution where training in teaching is not demanded. There are many different ways to address this challenge. I set out one possible strategy below. 13.2.4.1 Recognize that there’s a problem First,ithastoberecognizedandacceptedbyinstitutionalleaders,teachers,instructorsandfaculty,the relevantunions,qualityassuranceboardsandstatefundingagenciesthatthereisamajorproblemhere. Donovanetal.(2019)inanationalsurveyofpost-secondaryinstitutionsinCanada,foundthatwhile71 percentofallinstitutionsratedonlinelearningasveryorextremelyimportantfortheirlong-termfuture, 79percentreportedthatthemainbarriertogreateradoptionofonlinelearningwasinadequatetraining, and in only 29 per cent of institutions was it required in order to teach online. Developingskilledteachers(andthat’swhatweneedinschools,collegesanduniversities)isasmuch an economic development as an educational issue. If we want people with the knowledge and skills neededin adigitalage,thenteachers mustgettheknowledgethemselvesabouthow todevelopsuch skills,andinparticularrecognizethatlearningtechnologiesandonlinelearningarecriticalcomponents in the development of such skills. 13.2.4.2 Start in graduate school It is much more economical and effective to prepare instructors properly at the start of their careers than to try to get large chunks of their time for training while in their mid or late careers. Although technology will change over time, the basic essentials of teaching and learning are relatively stable. Thustheproblemneedstobetackledatthepre-servicelevel.Forthosewishingtoworkasfacultyin universities,weneedtoexaminethepost-graduatedegreeandinparticularthePh.D.,toensurethatthere isadequatetimeforcoursesonandpracticeinpost-secondaryteaching,ordevelopaparallelroutefor developing teaching and research skills. 13.2.4.3Adopt a system-wide approach IdeallythestateorprovincialCouncilofUniversitiesorColleges,orschoolboards,shouldgettogether and develop a comprehensive system of training for all teachersand ensure that such programs arecontinuallyupdated.Similarly,acommonplanandsetofstandardsneedstobeestablished across ajurisdictionforhiringandpromotionlinked topropertraininginteachingandlearning,throughthe establishmentofappropriateworkinggroupsthatwouldincludeprofessionalsfromlearningtechnology units and professionaldevelopment offices. 13.2.4.4Self-help Weneedtowalkthetalk,andusetechnologytosupportprofessionaldevelopment.Increasingly,centres forteachingandlearningarecreatingwebsiteswith‘on-demand’resourcesforfacultyandinstructors, suchasbestpracticesinusingvideo,podcastproduction,ordesigningacoursewithtechnology. Too often,though,otherfacultydevelopmentsupportsitesfocusonthetechnicaloperationoftechnologyor justprovideascheduleoffacultydevelopmentworkshops,ratherthanprovidingpragmaticadvice on besteducationalpracticeintheuseofaparticulartechnologyormedium.Also,teachersandinstructors need to know about such sites – and use them. 13.2.4.5Set standards The system-wideworking groups should agree on a ‘core’ curriculum, minimum standards, and measures ofperformance for pre-service training in teaching for each sector. These standards should include knowledge and skills needed by learners in a digital age. No person should be hired to new positions that have a major teaching component without recognized training in teaching, once the training system is in place. ALT (Association of Learning Technologists), UK, providesprofessional accreditation of learning technologists,operatingatthreelevels(novice,career,advanced)throughcertifiedmembershipofALT (Association of Learning Technologists). It uses a combination of personal portfolios of work and peerassessment.Asimilarprogramcouldbeextendedtoteachersandinstructors,enabling aformof accreditation based on practice as well as taking courses. Forin-serviceprofessionaldevelopment,onestrategywouldbetorequireanindividualprofessional development plan for every teacher or instructorannually negotiated between the teacherand their head of department. This plan would include regular up-dating in new teaching methods and technologies,similar tothecompulsoryprofessionaldevelopmentprogramsformedicalpractitioners. Different individual professional development plans will be needed for different subject areas. 13.2.4.6 Government as watch dog and enforcer Governments should exert pressure on school boards, colleges and universitiesto ensure that an adequate pre-service and in-service training system is in place, as a condition of future funding.Governmentsshouldrefusetofundanypublicinstitutionthatdoesnotfollowthestandardsfor training in teaching set and endorsed by therelevant system-wide authorities. 13.2.4.7 Integrate internally Blended and fully online teaching and learning technologies should be seen as integral components of professional development, not as separate activities. Thereforefaculty development offices should be integrated with learning technology support units into Centres for Teaching and Learning (either centrally or divisionally, depending on the size of the institution), where this has not already occurred. Figure 13.2.2 Teachers brainstorming about using technology for teaching 13.2.5Conclusion Wewouldnotdreamofallowingdoctorsorpilotsdotheirworkwithoutformaltrainingrelatedtotheir mainworkactivities, yetthisisexactly thesituationregarding teachinginpost-secondary education.

Click on image to go to web site. 13.3.1The need for learning technology support systems Therehavebeenmanyreferencesinthisbooktotheneedforteachersandinstructorstowork,wherever possible,withinstructionaldesignersandmediaproducerswhenteachinginadigitalage.Thereasons for this are fairly obvious: • no teacher can be an expert on everything; working in a team covers a wider a range of skills and knowledge; • technology should be used to decrease instructor and faculty workload, not to increase it, as at present; instructional designers in particular should be able to help teachers and faculty to manage their workload while still producing high quality teaching; media producers enable 689 subject experts to focus on content and skills development; • team teaching, with different skills within the team (two or more subject experts, instructional designer, media producer) will lead to higher quality teaching. As a result, over the last ten to twenty years, there has been a rapid expansion in the number of learningtechnologysupportsystems,bothcentrally,andinlargerinstitutions,withindifferentacademic departments.Overtime,separateunitsfocusing onfacultydevelopment,learningtechnologysupport, anddistanceeducationhavebecomemergedorintegratedintomulti-functionalunits,underavarietyof names, although legacy systems can sometimes takea long while to make this shift. 13.3.2The scaling problem Asthe move to blended, hybrid and online learning increases, sodoes the demand for these support units, to such an extent that one university I know well now has over 60 support staff and a budget of over $12 million a year for its central Centre for Teaching, Learning and Technology, plus several‘satellite’unitsinthelargerfaculties.Attheotherendasmallelementaryschoolwillbelucky to have one teacher with some training in maintaining the computers and the Internet added to their responsibilities.However,manyschoolsystemsalsohaveacentraleducationaltechnologyunitthatcan provide support to individual teachers and schools within the system. Institutionsarealreadyspendingagooddealtosupportjustthefullyonlinecoursesorprograms.We havegoodmodelsherebasedoninstructionaldesignersandmediaspecialistsworkinginateamwith instructors in developingfullyonline courses.Thisway, thespecial designrequirements forstudents studying off campus can be met. However,atthemoment,fullyonlinecoursesconstitutesomewherearound10-15percentofallthe credit-basedteachinginNorthAmericanuniversities.Whathappenswhenwegoto85percentormore of the teaching being blended?

However, without a design strategyforblendedlearning,andadequatesupportforfacultyandinstructors,itisalmostcertainthatthe qualitywillbepoor,anditiscertainthatallthepotentialbenefitsofblendedlearningfortransforming the quality of teaching will not be achieved. Tryingtoextendthesupportsystemfromfullyonlinetoblendedcoursesandprogramswillultimately beunsustainable.Althoughsupportunitswillbeessentialtogetblendedlearningsuccessfullystarted, teaching activities must be economically sustainable, which means faculty and instructors will eventuallyneedtobecomeabletodesignandmanageblendedlearningeffectivelywithoutcontinuous andongoingsupportfrominstructionaldesignersandmediaproducers.Thiswillrequireahugetraining and retraining effort for instructors. 13.3.3 Faculty training or support units?

Thus a balance needs to be found between the provision of training in the useoflearningtechnologiesandtheneedforlearningtechnologysupportunits,whichiswhyfaculty developmentandlearningtechnologyunitshavetendedtobecomeintegrated,andwhyinstitutionsneed adefinedstrategyforsupportingteachingandlearning. Thusalthoughitispossibleforaparticularly dedicated teacher to teach successfully without such support, learning technology support units are becomingan essential service for most teachers and instructors. 13.4 Conditions of employment Figure 13.4.1 Class size affects the capacity to develop the skills and knowledge needed in a digital age Therearecurrentlysomemajorchangesinconditionsofemploymentthatwillinfluencetheabilityof individual teachers and instructors to deliver the kind of teaching needed in a digital age. 13.4.1Class size Themostobviousisclasssize.Althoughsomeeconomiesofscalearedefinitelyachievablethroughthe useoftechnologyforteaching(seeforinstance,Bates,2013),andthereisnomagicnumberastohow manystudentsthereshouldbeperteacher,wehaveseeninearlierchaptersthatinstructorpresenceand theinteractionbetweensubjectexpertsandstudentsarecriticalfactorsindevelopingtheknowledgeand skills needed in a digital age. Althoughtechnologycanreplacetheneedforinstructorsforthetransmissionofcontent,theneedfor 693 ongoingcommunicationbetweenteacherandstudentsfordeepunderstandingandthedevelopmentof skills,meansthattheresoonbecomesalimit,intermsofthenumberofstudentsperinstructor,beyond whichtheteachingrapidlystartstobecomeineffective,atleastintermsoftheknowledgeandskillsthat matter most (Carey and Trick,2013). Thusthemajorchallengeisinuniversitiesandsomelargetwo-yearcolleges,wherefirstandsecond yearclassescannumberinthethousands,andeveninthirdorfourthyearclasses,inthehundreds.What canbedonetoensurethatteacherstudentratiosarekepttoamanageablesize?Institutionshavetakena number of different approaches to this challenge. 13.4.2 The increased use of contract instructors and teaching assistants One of the biggest changes to universities in North America over the last twenty years has been the growthofnon-tenuredteachingfacultyinuniversities.Anexplosioninundergraduateenrolmentsacross Canada–400,000morestudentsfrom2002 to2012–hascomewithoutacorrespondingincreasein tenure-trackfaculty. Whilethenumberofinstructorsdoubledbetweenthe1980sand2006,there was adeclineof10percentintenureandtenure-trackfaculty(Chiose,2015).Thepositionis,ifanything, evenmoredramaticintheUSA,whereuniversitiesandcollegesweremuchharderhitbytheeconomic crisis in 2008 than their Canadian counterparts. In an article in Canada’s leading newspaper, the Globe and Mail, Simona Chiose wrote (2018): Canadian universities say they can no longer afford to deliver higher education through tenured academics who may spend more than a third of their time engaged in research. Instead, most universities have decided that, to staff their classrooms at reasonable cost, they must turn, in varying degrees, to contract instructors and teaching-track faculty. Contractstaffsuchasadjunctsorsessionalsusuallyhaveeitheradoctoraldegreeinthesubjectarea, or strongly related work experience for more vocational subjects. In Canada, the union representing contractinstructors(CUPE)isfightingtogetmultiyearcontractsforsessionalinstructorswhonowhave toreapplyeachyearfortheirjobs.Ideally,theunionwouldlikeuniversitiestogivesessionalinstructors priority for teaching-track jobs, which do not have tenure, but have more job security than contract positions. With job security can come opportunities for training in teaching. However,anevenmorealarmingdevelopmentinrecentyearshasbeenanincreasingtendencytouse post-graduatestudents asteachingassistants,oftenresponsiblefordeliveringlectures to200students ormoreinfirstandsecondyearcourses.Thismodelisalsobeingincreasinglyusedwhereinstitutions aremovingtoahybridmodel,combiningbothonlineandface-to-facecomponents,especiallywherea formerverylargelecture-basedcourseisbeingredesignedforhybridlearning.EvenincludingtheTAs, theinstructor/studentratioisoften1:100orhigherfortheselargeenrollmentcourses.Thereisusually noadditionaltrainingforTAsabouthowtoteachonline,althoughinmany–butbynomeansall–cases, they do get some kind of training in teaching face-to-face. Withfullyonlinecourses,though,adifferentmodelhasoftenbeenusedwheretheinstructor:student ratiohasbeendeliberately targeted atunder40forundergraduatecourses,andunder30forgraduate courses.Scalinguphasbeenhandledbyhiringadditionalpart-timeadjunctorassociateprofessorson contract.Theadjunctswouldbepaidtotakeashortonlinebriefingcourseonteachingonlinewhichsets outtheexpectationsforonlineteaching.This wasanaffordablemodelbecausetheadditionalstudent tuitionfeeswouldmorethancoverthecostofhiringadditionalcontractinstructors,oncethecoursewas developed (Bates and Poole,2003). However, this has been possible because most of suchonline courses have been aimed mainly at higher level undergraduate students or graduate students. With both blended and online courses now beingtargetedatlargefirstandsecondyearclasses,newmodelsarebeingdevelopedthatmaynothave thesamelevelofquality asthe‘bestpractice’online courses.Thisis aparticularlydifficultissuefor several reasons: • practices both for dealing with large face-to-face classes and with online classes vary considerably within each form of delivery, and from one institution to another, so making generalizations is fraught with danger; • decisions about whether to use teaching assistants or part-time, contract instructors, are driven more by financial considerations thanby best pedagogical practice; • there are other factors at work besides money and pedagogy in the use of teaching assistants and adjunct faculty, such as the desire to provide financial support to international and graduate students, the idea of apprenticeship in teaching, and the supply and demand effects on the employment of doctoral graduates seeking a career in university teaching and research; • there is no golden mean for instructor/student ratios in either blended or online learning. In the mainly quantitative/STEM subjects, much higher ratios are sustainable without the loss of quality, through the use of automated marking and feedback, for the theory component, while the practical componentrequires much lower ratios due to the need to share equipment and monitor students; • MOOCs are (wrongly) giving the impression that it is possible to scale up even credit-based online learning at lower cost, by eliminating learning support provided by tenured faculty. Despitethesecaveats,thereisagenuineconcernthattheover-relianceonteachingassistantsforonline and blended courses will have three negative consequences for both students and online learning in general: • as with the large face-to-face classes, the pedagogy for online or blended courses will resort more to information transmission, due to the TAs’ lack of training and experience in teaching online; • for the online or hybrid courses, student drop-out and dissatisfaction will increase because, especially in first and second year teaching, they will not get the learning support they need when studying online. As a result, faculty and students will claim that hybrid or fully online learning is inferior to classroom-based instruction; • faculty and especially faculty unions will see online learning and blended learning being used by administrations to cut costs and over time to reduce the employment of tenured faculty, and will therefore try to block its implementation. Whycan’tTAsprovidethesupportneededonlineiftheycandothisforface-to-faceclasses?First,itis arguablewhethertheydoprovideadequatesupportforstudentsinlargefirstyearclasses,butinonline coursesinsubjectdomainswherediscussionisimportant,wherequalitativejudgementsanddecisions havetobemadebystudentsandinstructors,whereknowledgeneeds tobedevelopedandstructured, in other words in any field where the learning requires more than the transmission and repetition of information,thenstudentsneedtobeabletointeractwithaninstructorthathasadeepunderstandingof thesubjectarea.Thustherearegoodreasonstohireadjunctfaculty(asusuallytheyalreadyhavepost.graduatequalifications)toteachonlineorinblendedformats,butnotTAsingeneral(althoughtherewill always be exceptions). 13.4.3The elephant in the room However, the discussion about the use of adjuncts and TAs masks a more significant issue. There are two factors that lead to the very large class sizes in first and second year that faculty and their unions really don’twant to talk about: • the starvation of first and second year students of teaching resources; senior faculty concentrate more on upper level courses, and want to keep these class sizes smaller. As a consequence first and second year students suffer; • teaching subsidizes research: too often tuition revenues get filtered off into supporting research activities. The most obvious case is that if teachers spent more time teaching and less doing research, there would be more faculty available for teaching. Teaching loads for experienced, tenured faculty are often quite light and as stated above, focused on small upper level classes.Areport from the Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario (Jonker and Hicks,2014) suggested that if professors whom it has classified as laggards in research doubled their teaching time, it would be the equivalent of adding 1,500 faculty members across the province, enough to staff an additional mid-sized university. 13.4.4 The increasing diversity of teachers Muchhas been said in this book about the increasing diversity of students, and the implications for teaching. We should add to that the increasing diversity of teachers: • fully tenured, research-focused faculty, with very high academic qualifications but relatively little or notraining in teaching; • contract adjunct or sessional instructors, highly qualified academically, but with little or no chance of professional development in the teaching area; • teaching assistants, with mid-level academic qualifications and little or no training in teaching; • work-experienced vocational and technical instructors, with a small amount of training in teaching; • school teachers,well trained in general teaching methods, but few with training specifically for teaching in a digital age. Thereasonsforandthesignificanceofthisincreasingdiversityofteachersandinstructorsisbeyondthe scopeofthisbook.Nevertheless,withoutsomekindofjobsecuritythereislittleopportunityorincentive for training in new technologies and teaching methods. References Bates,A.andPoole,G.(2003)Effective Teaching with Technology in Higher Education: Foundations for Success San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Bates, T.

The projects aim to develop specific, pre-identified skills, such as critical thinking, problem solving, and collaborative working. • students in each group of six or seven work through online discussion forums or face-to-face on each project, depending on convenience to the students. The discussion forums are lightly moderated by the TAs, mainly to ensure that students are on topic and respectful to each other; if serious issues arise, these are referred to the senior professor; • TAs mark the group assignments, following rubrics decided earlier, and the senior professor monitors and calibrates the marking between instructors; for each student their group mark (50%) is added to their individual mark (50%) from the end-of-semester computer-marked assignment; • the senior professor meets for one hour a week with a different group of 33 students three times a week either face-to-face or synchronously online; this means that every student gets at least one hour of personal interaction with the senior professor during the semester.The sessions are used to discuss key issues in the course and focus on the pre-determined skills development. Thefollowingdesignattemptstobuildinatleastsomeopportunitiesforthedevelopmentofhighlevel skills in a very large class: 699 Whatever detailed design is done, these large courses should have a clear business model to work with,whichbasicallyprovidesanoverallbudgetforthecourse,thatincludesthecostoftheTAs,and takesaccountofthestudentsnumbers(morestudents,morebudgetedmoney),butallowingthesenior professor to build the team as best as possible within that budget.

It can do this best by having a formal plan or strategy that sets out: • the rationale for changes; • the goals or outcomes that such changes will lead to (for example, learners with specified skills and competencies); • actions that will support the changes (for example, funding for new course design, re.organisation of services); • a financial strategy to support the intended changes,such as funding for innovation in teaching; • a way of measuring successful implementation of the strategy. There are various ways in which such a strategy may be developed (see Bates and Sangrà, 2011), including top-down and bottom-up processes for setting overall goals, but in a university it may be throughanannualacademicplanningprocesswheredepartments/facultiesmustsubmittheirplansfor thenextthreeyears,includingresourcesneeded,basedonmeetingtheoverallacademicgoalssetbythe university.Insuchaplanningcycle,itisimportanttoincludethegoalsformeetingtheneedsoflearners inadigitalageas‘targets’fordepartmentswhendrawinguptheirplans.Theseplansshouldindicatenot only content to be covered but also delivery and teaching methods to be used, with a rationale for them. Manyuniversities and colleges are in the process of developing or implementing such plans,such astheUniversityofBritishColumbia’sFlexibleLearningInitiative andtheUniversityofOttawa’s e.learningplan.Indeed,atleastinCanada,mostinstitutionshaverecognisedtheneedforastrategicplan for‘e-learning’.Donovanetal.(2019)foundthat71percentofrespondingpost-secondaryinstitutions reported that online learning is very or extremely important for the institution’s long-term strategic or academic plan. However, only 42 per cent actually had implemented or were implementing a strategic plan for e-learning, and it is not know how closely these plans are tied to the development of the knowledge and skills needed in a digital age, or whether they focus mainly on resources or organizational issues. Nevertheless, a good plan, preferably dynamic and continually reviewed, is essential for such developments. Lastly, it is of courseimportant foranyone whohasread thisbook tomake sure theyareactively engagedinsuchprocesses,tohelpshapepolicyanddirection.Withoutinstitutionalsupport,itwillbe difficult to make significant changes. References Bates, A. and Sangrà, A.

Well, I’m about half-way through a really neat program called Global Science. We get to choose from about five or six problems to research. At the moment, the problem I’ve chosen is called ‘Stopping the flu.’ Basically, we’re looking at the influenza virus, and how to prevent pandemics. I thought when I started it would be all medicine, but I’m having to do math, geography, agriculture, even management and communications, as well as other types of science because they are all related in 713 some way to the problem we are looking at. We work as a group on defining the problem, collecting data, and interpreting the results. I’m in a group of 25 students, and they are from all over the world. Altogether there are over 2,000 students taking the program. My main instructor, Dr. Madelaine McVicar, who is responsible for my group of 25, is based the other side of the country in a hospital in Halifax, but really she’s more like a conductor of an orchestra, because the course uses experts from all over the world, some of whom come in with just short podcasts or YouTube videos, while others run webinar sessions that deal with specific questions as they come up in our research. Dr. McVicar is great at finding resources to help us, and we also occasionally get sessions online with some of the professors at UCC who helped design the program. What threw me at the beginning was the lack of lectures or pre-determined weekly study topics. Although we all had to do a set of modules on basic research methods, and we have a sort of program guide on the web designed by the UCC profs, we choose study topics and are provided with a guide to a wide range of resources, mainly free stuff available all over the Internet, such as published papers in open access journals or stuff in MOOCs that will directly help us with the research problem we are tackling. The course web site gave us some leads as to where to look, and we had to provide an interim report early on to Dr. McVicar that listed the resources we were accessing or looking for. Some of these topics, such as the molecular structure of the flu virus, are pretty obvious, but other topics we had to identify ourselves. I was particularly interested in the link between international travel and the spread of flu. One of the things we have to do always is to provide an evaluation of the sources we use and their reliability. Each month the group has to create our own online reports – called e-portfolios – which shows the progress we’ve made on the research question each month. In the end, we get 50 per cent of our marks from the monthly group e-portfolios and the other 50 per cent from an individual e-portfolio we each create summarizing the whole project and our individual contribution to the project. Dr. McVicar does the marking and grading. There’s about 20 other student groups from UCC researching the same question, and we are sharing data across the groups, so we get great help and feedback from the other groups as well, through a discussion forum and a shared web site for the monthly e-portfolios. Because of my job, I’m particularly interested in mortality rates from different kinds of flus and I was able to hook up with another student in another group who turns out to be a specialist in that subject, working for a Swiss insurance company – it might even lead to a job for me! Because of the agreements UCC has made with many hospitals and health authorities around the world, we’re getting access to some great data. We often have to go and find local data ourselves, such as the number of local hospital admissions for flu in a particular week. For instance, we were able to track the spread of a particular strain from the first week of our course, when it was identified in China, across the world over the following five months. UCC also has an agreement with IBM to load the data and use some of their analytics as well. Apparently UCC got money from one of the research councils to support some of the research on this program because of the ability to draw on so many sources of relatively raw data from around the world, which means my group sometimes get Skyped by one of the UCC profs who wants access to our data! Another group even got asked by the WHO (the World Health Organization, not the rock group) for their data. Many of the international students are in other universities, and will transfer the credits into their own program, although a lot of the students are also sponsored by employers, such as hospitals or government agencies. You can in fact get a badge for successfully completing just one of the research problems, and a diploma for doing all three. However, the final 60 credits of the degree program requires me to do my own, individual research project, and I think I’ll try and do that, because I need that to go on to grad school, although everyone says that doing the individual research project is pretty tough, as the standard is very high. But what I really like about this program is that I’m learning so much, so quickly. We’re dealing with a real problem, and you know, having so many people from such different backgrounds all working on the same problem means that I feel we are actually making a difference, as well as studying. Acknowledgement: This scenario was originally developed for the U.K. Open University and is usedwiththeirpermission.Thescenario wasinfluencedbyMcMasterUniversity’s integratedscience program.However,theMcMasterprogramisanon-campusprogramlimitedtoahighlyselectedgroup of 50 students. Appendix 1: Questions to guide media selection and use ThequestionsonthefollowingpagesshouldbeusedinconjunctionwithChapter8,andaddressareal context that you may be facing, such as designing a new course. It is recommended you work through each question one by one, possibly making notes of your answers.Itisalsorecommendedthatyoudothisinafairlysystematicmannerthefirsttwoorthreetimes whenfacedwithapossiblechoiceofmediaforawholecourseorprogram.Thiscouldtakeafewdays, allowingtimeforthinking.Somequestionsmayneedtowaituntilotherquestionshavebeenanswered.

Raymond Chang School of Continuing Education, Ryerson University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada As a team dedicated to supporting instructors in using educational technology as a vehicle for instruction, our collective review of Tony Bates’ latest work, Teaching in a Digital Age, has been anchoredinthepracticalrealitiesofsupportingpedagogicalchangeinhighereducation.Afterdecades ofcontributionstotheevolvingknowledgebaseanddiscoursearoundeducationaltechnology,including twelve texts related to the subject, Bates has now provided educators worldwide with the gift of a resource for moving forward in somewhat perplexing times. This book is a model in many respects. It is published in open format – an increasingly adopted, if somewhat debated, mode of knowledge dissemination with which anyone in research and education today must familiarize themselves. Bates(2014)offersthebookasa“coach”tosupportinstructorsinfosteringtherequired“thinkingand knowledge”forstudentsuccessinlearningenvironmentsthatareincreasinglyimpactedbytechnology (p.1).The worklivesup tothiscoaching analogy to the extent that it offers a roundedand realistic training regimen of sorts, to help strengthen the instructional design and decision making skills of instructors and educational administrators; however, just as the artifacts and content of technology.enhancedteachingmustbestrategicallyorganizedandpresentedtobestsupportlearners,Bates’ideas and commentary require further organization and clarification to optimize their benefit to his audience. One of the greatest strengths of Teaching in a Digital Age is that Bates “walks the talk” of active facilitation of learning rather than the passive transmission of knowledge. From the very beginning, Bates makes clear why his selected topics and stated objectives matter and how they will make a meaningfuldifferenceintheprofessionalpracticeofhisintendedaudience.To supporthis ownwork andobservations,heguidesreaders,throughreferencesandweblinks,tomanyvaluable,supplementary resources. He brings theories and concepts alive through vignette-like scenarios, practical real-world examples,andcasestudiesfromarangeofinstitutionsofhighereducation.Likeanygoodfacilitator, Bates presents content in a range of formats, including text and rich media such as videos, photos, diagramsandillustrations.Learningactivitiesandreflectivequestionsmotivatereaderstoimmediately applyBates’ideastotheirownworkandcontext.Assuch,thebookisatremendousprimerineffective pedagogy for all modes of teaching and learning. Chapters 6 to 8 of Teaching in a Digital Age guide the reader through the world of educational technology and new media. For instructors and course designers who are exploring different media to enhance their courses, these chapters are “must reads.” Bates presents his previously published SECTIONSmodel asaframeworkforwhen,howandwhymediashouldbeusedininstruction,and realisticallyconveysthecomplicationsthatcansurrounditsimplementation.Whilethesechaptersare comprehensiveandprovidevariedpracticalsupportstodecisionmaking,thebookwouldbenefitfrom additional examination of issues such as the impact of mobile technologies on media selection and compliance requirements for accessibility. ItmaybethatBates’strategicchoiceofanopenandtransparentauthoringprocessprecipitatedcertain challengestoorganizationandclarityforthebook.Priortoitsofficiallaunch,thebookwascirculatedfor feedbackamongBates’colleaguesand,throughhisblog,thewiderprofessionalcommunity.Thetype ofcommentaryemergingfromtheseconsultations,whileundeniablyvaluable,cannotreplacetheadept, 745 professionaleditingthattypicallyaccompaniescommercialpublishing.Forexample,afterestablishinga solidtheoreticalandpracticalfoundationinteachingtheoryandmethodsinChapters1to4,Batesoffers afullandlengthychapterexaminingtheunavoidableandcontroversialtopicofMassiveOpenOnline CoursesorMOOCs(Chapter5).Thereisnoquestionthatabooksuchasthisoneshouldacknowledge andexaminethistrend,givenitsextensivereachandimpactonthefield(andBatesdoessothroughout many ofhisotherchapters); however, theflowofthebookwouldbewell servedif someofhiskey messagesfromChapter5couldberedistributedwhererelevantthroughoutthebook.Similarly,Chapter 9,whichlooksatmodesofdelivery,mightintegratemoreeffectivelyifplacedearlierinthebook,i.e., adjacenttothechapters onteachingmethods(Chapters3and4).Additionally, the“KeyTakeaways” section – a very helpful feature of the book – isprovided at boththe beginning and the end ofeach chapter.Offeringjustoneinstanceofthissection,attheendofeachchapter,mighthelptostreamlinethe content.Addressingissuesofsequencingandrepetitionsuchasthesewillenhancetheoverallimpactof Bates’ message. Havingidentifiedsomehighlightsanddrawbacksofthebook,thefactremainsthatBateshasshared his singular abundance of knowledge in an engaging and accessible way.

On the other hand, there is a ‘hidden contract’ between the expansion of post.secondary education, and the need to create a work-force that is skilled, adaptable and competitive. I don’t see a necessary conflict here. Many of the activities we consider to be central to the purpose of a university can fulfill these work-force needs with relatively little tweaking. 2. The diversity of the student body and the easy availability of content raises the importance of good quality teaching based on sound pedagogical principles and research in learning. This means professionalizing teaching in post-secondary education. 3. Technology change is constant. Indeed if anything it is accelerating. New technologies that could be applied in education are being developed all the time. So technology is not going away. It’s no use shutting your eyes and hoping that you can manage without making some decisions about whether to use technology or not in your teaching. The pressure to use technology is going to increase,rather than ease up. 4. Relatively few technologies are designed specifically for education. There is more push from manufacturers and technology advocates than pull from instructors. Nevertheless it is clear that over time, many technologies have proved valuable educational tools. 5. There’s a lot to choose from, and there are some major differences between tools. Researchers and instructorsneed to understandthe educational differences, if any, between different technologies. 6. It is only in the last few years that technology has started to make major changes to the way we deliver education. Distance education and online learning were more of a fringe or peripheral activity to the main provision of learning, which was in classrooms and on campuses. But this is definitely beginning to change. Technology is forcing us to examine more fundamentally the purpose and process of teaching, what constitutes valid knowledge, and how best to acquire it. 7. All thismeans you need some kind of framework for making decisions about whether or not to use a technology, and how best to use it. This is the main purpose of this book. 751 Appendix 4: Feedback on Activity 7.1 How many technologies can you see in Figure 7.1? Well, this is an unfair question, partly because the photo doesn’t show all the technologies, andalso becauseyouwouldn’tknowwhatsoftwareorserviceswereincluded,butjustfortherecord,here’smy list: Hardware 1.Laptop computer 2.Music CD 3.Book:yes,aprintedbookisatechnologicalartefact!Itdoesn’thavetobedigitaltobeatechnology. 4.Mobile phone 5. Satellitereceiver/converter 6. Televisionmonitor 7.DVD player 8.Apple TV box 9.Audio-visualreceiver/control box with7 channels, 1080p HDMI, Dolby and DTS format support 10.Loudspeakers (3 in picture, including a woofer, back right) 11.
